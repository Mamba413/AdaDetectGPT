        "We had dinner here last night. It was our second time eating at Moishes, and the place had been remodeled since the last time we were there about a decade ago. It looks like the inside of a casino. Wall-to-wall carpet, glass chandeliers, wood paneling. The tables are packed in, and the place was full to the gills on Friday night. It was fairly raucous. The ambiance is not unpleasant; it's just very lively. Perfect for people watching. \\n\\nThey seat you and bring bread, good coleslaw and pickles right away, which is nice. We ordered the shrimp cocktail, a ribeye and a porterhouse, fries, a Montecarlo potato and mushrooms. The sides were tasty. The steaks were not. Good quality meat, but it was bland, under spiced, grey on the outside instead of charbroiled. Weirdly enough, Moishes actually sells a brand of steak spice, but there was no evidence of it being used in the restaurant.",
        "Hmmmm - not sure how this place has won awards or was so busy the night we went. \\n\\nWe were greeted promptly and seated right away, always a plus. We were greeted by two different waiters - not a big deal as they were busy. BUT when our waiter came up to the table (and it's really loud so it was hard to hear him) we weren't ready to order drinks yet, and after greeting us he just walked away. Again, it was loud so I'm not sure if he said anything but it didn't look like it.\\n\\nWhen he came back, we ordered drinks and asked about appetizers. He recommended the lollipops and was forthcoming with offering suggestions, which again was good.\\n\\nThe lollipops were minced up chicken meat rolled up and fried - extremely strange. They menu made it sound like they were more like skewers or chicken wings, not minced chicken meatballs. And the taste was off too, just a weird app.\\n\\nOrdered the",
        "Cox has super lousy customer service. From the phone reps to the techs to the supervisors. My appointment today (which was a bogus problem on their end, not mine) was for a 3 -5 pm window. So I worked to fit this time into my schedule and bargained with coworkers to get out of work early. 5:45 comes and nobody shows...So I call Cox. It is now 6:45 and I am still waiting for somebody to take me off hold. Meanwhile I am \\\"\"live-chatting\\\"\" with a rep named Maritza R. who cannot tell me if the tech will be arriving and tells me that if they aren't there in the window they wont come. I told her that her customer service is lousy and I would like a manager. She promptly ends the chat. So I start a new chat. I get a fellow named Federico and immediately ask for a manager without disclosing any of the previous information.",
        "This was probably one of the most disappointing massages I've had in my life. \\n\\nThe location doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside is pretty nice. The massage tables are heated and really comfortable. \\n\\nMy friend and I made reservations for 50 minute massages, but decided when we got there that we wanted an 80 minute one. The receptionist said that they couldn't accommodate us, which is understandable. But when we were done there was no one waiting to go next and it seemed like more than 2 masseuses were free.\\n\\nI chose the combination of deep tissue and Swedish massage. The masseuse said she would apply the deep tissue massage for the areas that needed it. I specifically mentioned that I had a huge knot in my lower back, yet the therapist spent less than 5 minutes on it initially, and only worked on it after I asked how much time was remaining near the end of the massage. After she started working on it she told me that it was too huge to get out in one session and I should come back in a couple weeks. Yeah not happening... I was only here for the weekend and there's no way I would pay for this overpriced massage again.\\n\\nI checked in for the free foot scrub, but never got it. I guess that takes away from your massage time because she started to do something with my feet before I told her to",

The last movie I saw here was the first Matrix movie... and I don't think much has been updated in the past 13+ years since then.\\n\\nSwung by to see Rush (by Ron Howard); it was a Sunday at 6:20pm - the parking lot was nearly empty. The ticket sales person was friendly; she made a little small talk and said that she heard Rush was a great film - apparently she was going to try to watch it tomorrow. I appreciated the chat; all too often stores/shops/etc are staffed with drones. Not the case here.\\n\\nFigured I'd treat myself to a small popcorn and a soda. Concession stand had zero people in line; another very friendly staff member asked if she could get me anything. I placed my order and she did something that made me want to rate this place at 5 stars: she said, \\\"\"I'll fill your popcorn half-way, and if you'd like me to add butter",

Introductions were in order we sat down and at this point I just wanted to take a look at the gym to see what was available. Griffin was not having it! He ignored my request and wanted to continue with my goals. Told him I just wanted to do cardio and to lose weight. I asked to see the gym before we discussed prices so I have a better idea what I was looking at. Griffin was not having it. \\\"\"I want to get to know you\\\"\" I asked\\\"\" Can you get to know me after the tour?\\\"\" Griffin was not having it. I told him you are not listening to your guest or your customer. He did not care and still wanted to continue with his scripted speech and still wanted to still get to know me. It was not until I stood up ready to leave that he said OK you can go ahead and take a look yourself. I went on a tour of the gym myself and roommate with no help from Griffen. Came back and he wanted to know our height and weight and we just wanted to know more about prices. Finally having enough I got up to leave because he wanted to do what he wanted ,and not the request of his guest. My roommate stayed behind and thanked",

I was not very happy with the whole process from start to finish. There are too many ridiculous rules. For one thing, I think it's good business to honor coupons that are presented, whether or not they are expired--the purpose is to attract business, right? Then we need to bring in our own cake, which is fine, but you can't say we NEED to bring one type of food item, and then BAN other food items. I brought some chips and crackers to the party room. Then I was told (after I already set everything up) that we couldn't have snacks in the party room. Or drinks. Would YOU like to attend a party with no snacks or drinks?

The food is not the same and not in a good way, I just had the lunch special with the $2 upcharge for shrimp instead of chicken. The shrimp is undercooked, lower grade and on 4 little ones for the extra $2. I guess it breaks down to 50 cent per shirmp that isn't even close to as good as it was. The Pad Thai Noodles are all clumped together and you can't use the cheap flimsy plastic fork to even get through it. The noodles are dark brown and full of what taste like GARLIC!

I was hopeful after calling them up and asking them if their recipes were different from Royal Thai. Royal Thai also had pretty lame curry, so I was excited to give Weera a try.\\n\\nI ordered the duck curry. It was listed on a sign outside as a \\\"\"special\\\"\" dish. It looked nice and red and yummy on the sign. When I got my duck curry, the look alone had me concerned. It was a light custardy color. The taste... bland as hell. I've never had such a bland curry before. Yeah, the waitress forgot to ask me what spice level I wanted, but this was just ridiculous. \\n\\nThe other ingredients weren't bad, although they added little cherry tomatoes to try and boost the flavorless curry. The duck was ok, and the veggies were fresh. This fact didn't help me enjoy my curry though, unfortunately.\\n\\nThe first time the waitress asked",

I sat down, looked at the menu for maybe 1 minute, and she came by and wanted to take my drink and food order at the same time.

The fries didn't come together so good for me. I'm just not sure if the sweetness of the sweet potato goes with the spicy, meaty flavors of the bulgogi and Korean chili sauce.

The food is bar food but it is well-priced and there is a good amount of diversity on the menu.

Upon entering the MO, guests travel up to the twenty-third floor to the Sky Lobby a refreshingly unique concept. However the Tea Lounge is just sort of there by the check-in desk. It has all the charm of a Starbucks kiosk in any lobby in any hotel in any major city in the country.\\n\\nOnce seated guests are treated to an amazing view of the city. The couches are extremely comfortable for lounging, not necessarily ideal for eating. The tea selections are seemingly endless with different herbal/floral combinations. The food offerings are meager to put it nicely. This is after all a high tea experience not a true meal. One would be advised to skip the",

We loved our room, it had every thing we needed except for a good coffee maker and microwave. The coffee maker was more of a water boiler and the microwave was available in a small cabinet in the lobby, which looked to be dated from the 80s. There is a pool and hot tub available, which was nice and the area we stayed in right near the pool, downstairs was pretty quiet for the weekend. They did a great job in cleaning up the room, though I wished they provided soap, shampoo that weren't dispensed from their shower and without having to ask at the front desk. Also there is no free breakfast, but provide room service dining from their restaurant out front.\\n\\nThe only cons are the lack of microwaves in room, safe didn't work, inefficient coffee maker, noisy AC that rattles while it's on and has a touchy thermostat.

Didn't really know what to expect because we've never stayed anywhere in Vegas except for the strip.\\n\\nOverall, we were pleasantly surprised that this place was pretty nice! The hotel itself is pretty modern and luxurious for the price we paid. The room was awesome. Great size, great view! The bed was super comfy, and the restroom was really nice and clean! The buffets were way cheaper than any other hotel I've ever gone to. The casino was okay and decently sized. Not as busy as casinos on the strip.

Wait staff are shuffling next to you and jostling to get by. You're standing in line being jostled on one side and have a loud kitchen in the other. You pay for your food. You sit and wait. The burgers weren't great. The meat was gummy and had the feel of biting into some gelatinous gooey meat like substance. Not a burger. The hubs had a super salty veggie burger and my kid had a grilled cheese that was basically a hamburger bun turned inside out and buttered within an inch if it's life and pan fried.

We normally play there either Sunday mornings or nights and Wed nights. If you want to join us and play look up Las Vegas Street Hockey on the Internet. The rink can get slippery due to some sand coming into it from the volleyball sand pit right next to the rink. I normally try to sweep up as much sand as I can before we play. The rink is a very good size, fences are high behind the nets, but I wish the nets were still there. The fences along the side help since you can use it to make passes",

We were the only ones there so early, and only one other guest arrived while we were eating, so I would say that reservations are not necessary until later in the evening.\\n\\nWe started with a platter of three hummuses - sun-dried tomato, kalamata olive, and black bean, accompanied with triangles of pita and some fresh veggies. The sun-dried tomato hummus was by far our favorite, but the others were delicious as well.\\n\\nI ordered the spanikopite platter, which came with some steamed veggies and a side of tzaziki sauce. It was a little on the dry side, but otherwise very good. Other dishes ordered in our group included the eggplant caprese-style, the Morrocan green olive chicken, and a special of bay scallops and linguini in chimichurri sauce. The eggplant was deliciously breaded without being greasy; the Morrocan chicken and side of couscous had a delicious cumin flavor, and the scallops and chimichurri sauce were great. The portions were large; we all asked for boxes and were disappointed that we couldn't sample their homemade desserts.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is definitely the star of the restaurant.

I was seriously in shock over the price of the M&Ms. Almost $5 for a small bag?! They have their own President's Choice brand, which was more reasonable than name brands and the items that I tried from the President's Choice brand, including the soda and the a variety of baguettes were excellent. The French baguette was particularly good. They also had a good selection of cheese here including many cheeses from Quebec. A goat cheese with figs that I picked up here was particularly good. I do agree with what other yelpers have noted about the customer service. I found that whenever I went here, whether early in the am or later in the evening, there was only one or two cash registers open. The lines were long. One time I ended up walking out of the store without buying the items I intended to because the cashier was just taking so long to resolve some issue with a customer",
        "My experience was poor. I was so excited to try this place after seeing and hearing so many good things. When I arrived the hostess was rude and pretended that I didn't exist until she realized that I wasn't going away. We were sat quite quickly, but it took nearly 15 minutes before our waiter came to take a drink order. I ordered ne of their signature drinks and was pleased when it arrived. Our waiter brought out bread and herb butter, but the butter was nearly frozen and impossible to spread over the cold bread. I was a little taken back by the pricing on the menu, and I'm not cheap by any means. In fact a table of eight were seated near us, and once they saw the menu, the entire party left. Well it took our waiter another 15 minutes to come back and take our order. I chose the beef tenderloin and my date chose the fish. After getting refilled three times, the waiter came to us and said that our food is coming, but that the kitchen was backed up. There weren't that many people there so I wasn;t buying it but we waited....and waited....and after 40 minutes I was brought a cold steak on a hot plate...not happy. I mentioned it to the waiter and all he said was that he",

I have two of my own so of course when I found out that this was being built directly across from the school I work at, I was there for the grand opening and several times since. There are two gated areas, one for small dogs and one for big dogs. I have to go to the small dog one as I have 2 small dogs. \\nI gave it 4 stars because there is always a shortage of waste bags when I go and it is a little smaller than I would have liked. My dogs don't seem to mind though. It is cute because there is a tree with a place to sit under it while your dogs are running around. \\nI obviously love the location because I live 5 minutes from work so that means I only live 5 minutes from this place (Remember, I work at",
        "On our recent trip to Vegas from the New England, we were craving ramen.

Yes, a lot of food for 3, but again, we're fatties! I could not finish my ramen (this NEVER happens!), because the broth was too oily and too salty. It was saltier and oilier than any kotteri broth I've ever had, really inedible. The noodles were perfectly cooked (though we ordered katamen - firm noodles - so that's a confounder), though. I was sad that I couldn't eat more of the noodles because the oily broth was just",
        "The wait for a walk in was 2 hours. I just came in for an x ray because my wisdom teeth were coming in. I figured it was going to be a easy visit but then they talked me into extracting a tooth by saying it would only cost $93, I don't know there are complications so that will be $165. I figure what the hell I'm already here I already waited might as well go through with it... Bad idea. \\nKeep in mind these are dental students not actual dentists, so they really are not that experienced especially when it came to the student that I had. So here's how it goes novacane my gums and go to town on my tooth for 45 minutes. The kid had to stop 3 times to take a breather and shake his arm out because it was getting tired , his assistant kept giving him looks like what are you doing man. He kept, how do I put this, wiggling his clamps on my tooth to the point where they were clanging around my other teeth for 45 minutes, any kept losing grip of his tools as well. After all that misery the kid asks another student for help, she is literally in there for 2 minutes and my tooth is finally out thank god. As it turned out that this procedure was a competency test for that student and the girl that helped him told him that he should say that he did not receive any help... so basically the kid cheated.

        "Best Buffet in Las Vegas. Period. \\n\\nMy only dislike about this place is the lack of good seafood choices. The sushi was pretty fresh. The clams/mussels/shrimp bar is a neat and delicious idea. The trout salad, salty fishy crostini, and seared salmon were alright. But the crab left something to be desired. I'm a huge crab-bie!! \\n\\nAll that aside, everything else was pretty darn good for buffet food. Tomato/ Corn Risotto. Angry Mac n' Cheese. Lamb. Carnitas. Ginger chicken. Gnocchi. Cheese plates. Pork belly sliders were nom nom. \\n\\nThe highlights for me were : crispy pork ears, grilled peaches and goat cheese crostini, and bone marrow. \\n\\nCrispy pork ears were so crunchy and salty, can be added to some dishes like the Mac N Cheese or Kimchi Fried Rice to blast the flavors.

        "Was in Vegas for the weekend for Punk Rock Bowling and wanted to check out the fight. I searched for somewhere showing the fight and came across this $10 UFC viewing party. My group decided to check it out and was very disappointed. For $10 you get to stand in a short line that takes forever because there are security guards frisking you and ruffling through your pockets and belongings. You then proceed to the ballroom where the seats are arranged in a clever circular octagon formation, facing several large screen projectors. It looked cool until you try to find a seat and realize that the screens are set too low and you can't get a full view of the fight unless you're in the front row because you will have trouble seeing around the person in front of you. Once seated you can visit the wonderful food court they have set up. $2 hot dogs, $1 bags of chips, and $1 canned soda. That's it, and you aren't allowed to bring in outside food or beverage. Maybe the reason for the short selection is the lack of tables they don't provide, just chairs. They did have a full bar for those interested in cocktails, as well as $1 bottled water. To make the evening that much better we had to wait 45 minutes for a cab to get back to our hotel because they had none waiting and there was nobody available to call",

It honestly doesn't seem to matter if we order right off the menu or if we ask for a small change to our order - something basic will always be missing (like lettuce) or done incorrectly when the food arrives. \\n\\nThen there's the fact that the order time really has slowed down, a lot - once we placed an order and nothing arrived for two hours. Sorry, but unless it's a major holiday that kind of wait for a sandwich is just too long. Most recently, it took an hour for our food to even get out the door (we know this because we called exactly an hour after ordering, and they said it was leaving then). Why couldn't they have warned us about this wait in advance? This is standard practice for other companies that deliver, is it not?\\n\\nThe final downgrade in service at Cafe are the problems with their phone and staff.

        "Unusual for a Vietnamese restaurant, I hold this place to the same standard of cleanliness I expect from a Chinese restaurant: if it tastes good and doesn't make me sick, it's a-okay! I have grown up in Asian restaurants and really, despite all the negative reviews, this place isn't that scary! If you're looking for ambiance, well, maybe you should save this one for another day. I can't say I've ever been to a Vietnamese restaurant where the decorations blew me away. However, if you are craving some mighty decent Vietnamese cuisine, you have arrived at your destination.\\n\\nI grew up on Oahu where Pho places are like McDonalds- they are practically on every corner. It being one of my favorite foods, I've been to a great many restaurants for pho, and have tried to find a place that can fill that big beef noodle soup void in my heart..( or stomach.. same thing) since moving to Arizona. I've come to the conclusion that there is nothing in Tucson. Chandler, however, is fortunate enough to have this little gem.\\n\\nThe bowls are large and very affordable. The easiest difference to distinguish between pho places is the broth. Saigon has a pretty good broth, and offers almost all the right condiments. The only thing this place is missing is sate, which is like chili oil with garlic or shallots, and culantro. If only",

        "I am shocked that I am barely writing this review for Wildflower Bread Company since I eat here at least twice a week. I used to be obsessed with Paradise Bakery but then I met Wildflower and so I dumped them. The reason? Their ingredients! So fresh, so delicious! I've literally had everything on their menu and there is nothing that I wouldn't recommend. Isn't that hard to admit when it's not your mom's food you are having? Well anyways, another thing I love about Wildflower is that they are always giving back to the community. A few months ago they were running a campaign on Instagram all you had to do was upload a picture of you to share a good deed you've done in your community. I uploaded one and had the most likes, not only did I get $100 dollar gift card but they also gave $100 dollars to a charity of my choice! I absolutely have a great experience every time I go here from the moment when I step a foot in the building to the moment I walk out. Their atmosphere is comfortable and clean at all times! I like the fact that the manager is always helping the team serve the food and ensuring everything is ok with the customers. They are just amazing!

My check engine light came on and I was having troubles with the AC making the car overheat. I made an appointment and when I took it to the garage I had to approach somebody first, which I didn't really like customer-wise. Dropped off my car at 7am, didn't get a call, waited till 2 in the afternoon then I called. They told me they were just getting started on it, which was frustrating. However, once they did, the service was thorough. They fixed the issue by the end of the day and the pricing was fair. The staff was knowledgeable, but I wish communication had been better. Overall, there\u2019s room for improvement, but I\u2019d consider returning.",
        "Staying at the Stratosphere was right up there with THE worst experience I have ever had at a hotel stay. I have traveled all over and stayed at many different hotels from 2 stars to 5 stars and this takes the cake on one of the worst. Not only did I find a COCKROACH on the first day on the nightstand next to where we sleep at night..!!!!!! Which alone is horrible and appalling, but the tub was completely disgusting with hair left from previous hotel guests and other particles. I can't express how important cleanliness is to me, and the state of the room was simply unacceptable. Moreover, the staff seemed indifferent to my concerns, offering no apologies or solutions when I reported the issues. The overall atmosphere felt neglected and outdated, making for a thoroughly disappointing stay. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable or hygienic experience. Save your money and look elsewhere.",
        "On 2/22 we had a company retreat in Rio. We have reserved 16 rooms and checked in all at the same time, paid all by a company credit card. There were not only room charges but also other charges like ballroom, meeting equipment, beverage, and so on. While believing we have paid for everything, today 6/6 I received this collection call from a collection agent. His name is Nelson. He said that it is reported to credit agency that $72.00 was unpaid. All the 16 rooms and all the expenses, thousands of dollars were paid, and to my surprise, this nominal amount had slipped through. I immediately contacted the hotel, hoping for clarity, and the manager assured me it was an oversight. They promptly resolved the issue and assured me the report to the credit agency would be retracted. While the initial call was unsettling, I appreciate the quick response from the hotel team in rectifying the situation.",
        "I got to the restaurant, looking forward to some great Thai food in the area. Lunch hours end at 2:30 (they close before dinner), and I arrived at 2:10. Didn't think it would be a big deal. When I walked in, the lady immediately told me that they close at 2:30 and handed me a menu as if I should order takeout. I asked, \\\"\"Can I eat here?\\\"\" and she said I could. I sat down, looked at the menu for maybe 1 minute, and she came by and wanted to take my order immediately. I felt rushed, but I quickly decided on the Pad Thai and a Thai iced tea. The food arrived surprisingly fast, which was a relief given the time constraint. The Pad Thai was flavorful, with just the right amount of spice and generous portions of chicken and shrimp. The Thai iced tea complemented the meal perfectly with its creamy, sweet taste.\n\nDespite the hurried start, the food quality was excellent. However, the rushed service left a slight sour note on what could have been a relaxing lunch. I understand the need to clear out before closing, but a more welcoming approach would have enhanced the experience. I would recommend the restaurant for its authentic flavors, but maybe avoid arriving too close to the end of their lunch hours for a more enjoyable dining experience.",
        "First Impressions for me were: I'm here for an early middle of the week lunch and they have people in both rooms, it is not crowded at 11:30am yet there are several people already here. They let me sit where ever I want instead of just taking me to a table, nice though it does not affect my rating.\n\nI'm seated and I notice the \"Garage Doors\" Urban Architecture and simple Decor so I like this! It's got Potential! Plenty of Outdoor seating too, Great designs, this place is a hidden gem. The menu is diverse, offering both classic and innovative options that cater to various dietary preferences. I opted for the avocado toast with a side of truffle fries, and both were deliciously satisfying. The staff was attentive, ensuring my coffee cup never ran dry. The ambiance is relaxed, making it perfect for both solo diners and groups. Prices are reasonable for the quality of food and service. I'll definitely be back!",

I'm from Chicago and love steakhouses, and have spent my fair share of $$$ on Charlotte's finest ones. BLT doesn't rank in the top 5... sorry.

        "Let me start by writing that the service was good, the waitress was prompt and attentive to the two of us. We were seated in a small room with 5 tables which was fine except that it was stuffy and a good look around the outdated room revealed a great deal of dust on rails etc. this of course makes you ask. What is the cleanliness in the kitchen? We had the tamales which was dry and the fois gras which was good. The squash was excellent and the spinach salad was excellent but way overdressed. We also had the lobster and basil pasta, which was unfortunately a letdown. The pasta was a bit overcooked, and the basil flavor was overpowering, masking the delicate taste of the lobster. Despite these hiccups, the overall meal was decent, and the attentive service certainly helped. However, I hope they make some improvements, both in terms of food quality and ambiance, to better match the service they provide.",
        "My new favourite hotel in Montreal. Rooms are massive; you get a living room, a kitchen (full fridge, stove, dishwasher, and microwave), a giant bathroom, and a bedroom. Kitchen has no cutlery/plates/etc but you can request them by calling downstairs. If you're lucky, your suite will have a giant jacuzzi (I'm 6'2\" and I fit in like a glove). I was here as part of a group so internet was included for free (pro-tip: it's worth asking about any deals they might have). The service was impeccable, with staff always ready to assist, ensuring every guest feels at home. The location is convenient, with numerous attractions within walking distance. Despite the hotel's central location, my room was tranquil, offering a perfect retreat from the bustling city. The modern decor and cleanliness made my stay even more enjoyable.

        "Back in 2007, my car (BMW 540i sport) was involved in a minor accident and one of the front rims was damaged (18\\\"\" M Parallel). The bodyshop (whom I had a working relationship with as I am a former auto dealer) outsourced finding a replacement to Wheel Specialists. Wheel Specialists sent the body shop a replica M Parallel. The rim was obviously a replica as the lip was slightly different, the color was slightly different, and the rim lacked the OEM BMW markings. Getting an OEM rim was very important as the OEM rims not only ensure a seamless match with the other wheels but also maintain the car's resale value and performance standards. I reached out to Wheel Specialists to address the issue, and to their credit, they were responsive and eventually located an authentic OEM rim.

We were immediately seated (in the bar area), and placed an order for some brews.\n\nTwo of the brews were unavailable - they had sold out. Substitutions were made and chips with queso were ordered.\n\nI'm familiar with many styles of queso... but I was shocked by Pasqual's \"queso\" - it was more like a soft-spread, lacking the gooey, melty texture I had anticipated. While it had a pleasant enough taste, it didn't fulfill the cheesy craving I was hoping for. On a brighter note, the salsa had a fresh kick, and the chips were perfectly crisp and warm. Our burritos arrived quickly and were generously portioned, with flavors that hit the spot. The service was friendly, though a bit rushed.

        "I had a reservation for a compact car for 4 days. At the upstairs counter I declined to upgrade to a larger car for $5 per day. According to the Enterprise website, a compact car is a Nissan Versa, a Toyota Yaris, or similar. Anything similar to those two cars would have suited our needs perfectly. When we arrived at the cars in the parking garage, I was told we would be in a Fiat 500. While I am sure the Fiat would have been fun to drive, it was much too small for our needs. Looking at the technical specifications for the Fiat 500, I found that its trunk space and rear passenger room were significantly less than what we\u2019d expected from the \u201ccompact\u201d category. After some back and forth with the parking garage staff, they kindly found us a Toyota Yaris, which matched our expectations. Despite the hiccup, the staff was accommodating and resolved the issue swiftly. Overall, our experience was positive, but I would appreciate clearer guidelines",

I thought about going somewhere else or just coming back some other time, but instead I browsed some of the shoes I've been eyeballing online. I saw their foot analysis station, with a wait behind all those with the cross country people. When I finally got my turn, the staff was incredibly attentive and knowledgeable. They took the time to analyze my stride and foot shape, which was really helpful in narrowing down my options. Despite the busy atmosphere, they maintained great energy and made sure every customer felt valued.\n\nI ended up trying on a few pairs and found the perfect fit. The cushioning and support were exactly what I needed for those grueling long runs. Plus, they offered a generous return policy, which gave me peace of mind just in case they didn't work out as well as expected. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience. Even with the crowd, the team's professionalism and expertise shone through. I'm now more excited and better prepared for my marathon journey. Definitely a place I'd recommend to other runners!",

The place is small with a main dining area and two larger tables to the side of the restaurant for larger parties. While waiting, we noticed the cozy atmosphere and welcoming staff, which made the time fly by. Once seated, we were treated to an impressive variety of fresh, flavorful rolls and sashimi that surpassed our expectations. The spicy tuna and salmon lovers rolls were particular standouts, and the service was attentive without being intrusive. The quality and creativity of the dishes here have definitely won me over.

        "Where do we start? The place is hot, dusty, very crowded, and so disorganized. Okay, that aside, the reason why we're giving this event a 1-star (0 if possible) is the false advertisement to various ticket sellers. They proudly say \"trucks are asked to sell food at a low price,\" this is well printed, and customer service even answers this question on their website. Well, let me save you the precious time, money, and save you from getting angry. Not only do you have to pay $12 for entrance, but you also have to pay $5 for parking. Once inside, the so-called \"low-priced\" food is anything but\u2014$8 for a small taco and $5 for a bottle of water. The lines were long, and the staff seemed overwhelmed and uninterested.

Once we started our meal, we immediately realized that the quality & presentation were worth such prices.\n\nI had the soup of the day (red vegetable soup) and a lobster salad. The soup was a delightful blend of flavors, perfectly seasoned, and comforting. The lobster salad was a highlight, with tender lobster pieces and a refreshing citrus dressing that elevated the dish.

On my way home I was smart enough to check my order (was going to do it at the window but seeing that their was tons of cars behind me I put faith in the Einstein workers.. big mistake). They completely forgot over half of my cream cheese. Little irritated (and pregnant.. ), I decided to turn around and head back to the store. Upon arrival, I went inside to address the issue.

It's a shame the service didn't match the quality of the food. I would hesitate to return, especially on a busy morning, unless they improve their efficiency and attention to detail.

For all the Yelpers out there, I simply ask that, before you write off Steak 'N Shake based on a 'Signature' 1/2 store that is the Tempe location, please try eating at an actual sit-down classic Steak 'N Shake restaurant. The Signature store is a far cry from the nostalgic charm and quality of the original establishment.

The ambiance strikes the perfect balance between cozy and lively, making it a great spot for any occasion. Whether you're a first-timer or a regular, you'll feel right at home. Highly recommended for foodies and casual diners alike!",
        "I'll be fair in saying that it's not the worst I've had because it wasn't, but please, for a restaurant in Vegas, I expected a bit more flair and flavor. My friends took me here because we would get entry to the club if we ate at the restaurant - now, I'm not big on spending loads of money on food, I prefer the simple yet delicious; but I thought, hell, it's a Vegas joint so it's bound to hit the spot.\n\nI was disappointed. My friend got sushi, and honestly, it was really good. My other friend got swordfish, which was prepared beautifully and tasted fresh. However, my grilled chicken was bland and uninspired, lacking the zest I was hoping for. The portion size was modest considering the price, and the sides were forgettable. The service was friendly but slow, which seemed odd given it wasn't a busy night. To top it off, the music was too loud, making conversation difficult. For the price, I expected a more complete",
        "I took my mom, sister, and niece to the Slider Truck at the Farmers' Market on Eastern and Richmar (Serene-ish). My niece was flabbergasted by the \"little sammiches truck,\" and pretty much made me order everything on the menu... including a nice little surprise that wasn't listed! (Always ask if there is a special not on the list... you could be pleasantly surprised!)\n\nI have two favorites... one being the Pulled Porky (listed as a specialty slider - limited edition, perhaps?). The pork was tender and perfectly seasoned, topped with a tangy slaw that added the perfect crunch. My second favorite was the BBQ Beef Brisket slider. It was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, with just the right amount of smoky sweetness. The truck\u2019s homemade sauces were an absolute delight, elevating each bite to the next level.\n\nThe staff was friendly and quick, making our visit even more enjoyable. Highly recommend checking them out for a fun, flavorful experience",
        "We had dinner here tonight for the first time. After reading several reviews in the paper about Liberty Market, and being fans of Joe's Farm Grill and Real BBQ, we were determined to get in here. We parked in the back and as we walked along the sidewalk next to Liberty Market, we noticed the long line trailing out of Joe's Real BBQ and then noticed the crowd inside Liberty Market. I was instantly impressed that someone can be so successful in today's shaky market and open restaurant after restaurant with business just booming.\n\nAs we walked in, we noticed that there was a line, but it moved swiftly. The ambiance was vibrant, with a mix of rustic and modern decor. We ordered the wood-fired pizza and the famous turkey sandwich. Both were exquisite, with fresh ingredients and bold flavors. The staff was attentive and friendly, creating a welcoming atmosphere. We left feeling satisfied and eager to return, understanding why Liberty Market has garnered such a loyal following.",
        "My wife and I, along with a friend, decided to try this restaurant for our New Year's Eve dinner at 7:00. When we arrived at the hotel, we noticed that this is where Stanford U. was holding their pep rally. The place was buzzing with Red and White and shirts with large printed letters 'S' or 'STANFORD'. Walking down to the restaurant we were greeted and told it would be a minute. The staff and waiters were very cordial. The place was packed full of people and the noise level was high, but it added to the festive atmosphere.\n\nDespite the crowd, our table was ready on time, and we were promptly seated. The menu featured a delightful array of dishes, and we decided to go for their New Year's special. Each dish was exquisitely presented, with flavors that exceeded our expectations. The staff remained attentive throughout, ensuring our glasses were never empty. Overall, a memorable evening with great food and vibrant energy.",
        "This was my first and last experience at the Vintage. My friend and I were looking for a place to eat lunch on a late Sunday afternoon. We found a coupon for buy 1 lunch and get 1 free so we thought we could get some really nice food at a decent price. The experience was horrible from the start. We walked in and it was not busy at all. We had to wait about 3-5 minutes before the hostess returned from the bathroom to greet us and seat us. While waiting, the bartender awkwardly looked over but did not offer to help, and two other staff members saw we were waiting and simply ignored us.\n\nOnce seated, our server took another 10 minutes to even acknowledge our presence. The food, when it finally arrived, was lukewarm and bland. Despite the discount, it was not worth the price. Overall, a disappointing visit with poor service and mediocre food. We won\u2019t be returning.",
        "The boyfriend finally agreed to go out for breakfast, and this made me beyond happy. The place: Rise and Shine in Southern Highlands. Very quaint, family-run breakfast/lunch spot.\n\nWe arrived just after 11 and had a 20-minute wait. Thank goodness for the gorgeous Fall weather. Our name was finally called, and a 10-13-year-old brought us to our table. Normally, the idea of children working in a restaurant annoys me. Restaurants are a serious business, and throwing your underaged kids in the mix is more distracting than it is helpful. But at Rise and Shine, it was different. The young host was polite and seemed genuinely enthusiastic about his role, instantly making us feel at home.\n\nThe food did not disappoint. I ordered their signature pancakes, which were fluffy and delicious, and my boyfriend opted for the omelet, which he declared as one of the best he's had. The warm, welcoming atmosphere and the incredible food made for a perfect breakfast outing.",
        "Dear Mr. Sushi,\\nI have been to this restaurant numerous times and I have enjoyed your bento boxes, sushi, salad, and soups. I was hoping to come here twice last week on different lunch dates, but as you were closed, I was unable to. I understand that business is slow when the school year is done and spring term exams are over, however in light of recent events, it has been made clear to me that you do not care about your loyal customers. I wanted to take some friends to Mr. Sushi on August 27, 2014. Dear Mr. Sushi,\n\nI have been to this restaurant numerous times and I have enjoyed your bento boxes, sushi, salad, and soups.

        "I was looking forward to their opening and now I feel I need to wait a few months longer before I try again. On a Friday night, a hostess/server greeted us after a good 5 minutes of waiting by the door and asked us if we would be ordering food since the kitchen was backed up. If we were to order, our food would arrive well over an hour of our arrival. Naturally, this was all the information we needed enough to say \"No, we're just here for a beer or two.\" Soon after, we were seated at the bar area, which was buzzing with activity. The ambiance was lively, and the beer selection was impressive, but the service was underwhelming. It took another long wait to catch the bartender's attention. While the beer was enjoyable, the overall experience felt rushed and a bit chaotic. I'm optimistic about their potential and hope they iron out these early hiccups soon.",
        "Sunday morning in the casino at the Palms is like being in God's waiting room. Having said that, it seems that the Palms is either a property with a 3-way split personality or it's having an identity crisis. Or both.\\n \\nI see 3 distinct things going on here:\\n \\n They clearly market and cater to the older local population, evidenced by crowds toting the most recent giveaway, which happened to be bathrobes. Yes, bathrobes. Now don't get me wrong, BJ and I have had a lot of fun with those bathrobes, but it's not exactly the thrilling vibe you'd expect from a Las Vegas casino. Then there's the younger crowd, drawn in by the trendy bars and vibrant nightlife. The contrast is stark when you see a group of 20-somethings in club attire breezing past the retiree crowd in their cozy robes. It's a peculiar juxtaposition that can be both amusing and bewildering.  \n\nLastly, there's the foodie sect, zeroing in on the eclectic dining options. From gourmet steakhouses to casual eateries, the Palms tries to be everything to everyone, which results in a mixed bag experience. While I appreciate the variety, it sometimes feels like the Palms is juggling too many identities at once, leaving me to wonder if it's a master of diversity or just a hub of contradictions. Overall, it\u2019s an entertaining visit, albeit a bit disjointed.",
        "Review for second experience only.\n\nI had such an amazing experience at Lawry's the first time I was there that I had to reserve to dine again for my birthday this past weekend. The second time around was not as satisfying as the first. The evening started off disappointingly when the bread was served cold, which was a stark contrast to the warm, freshly baked rolls I remembered. Our server, while polite, failed to inform us about additional charges for certain items, which left us with an unexpected bill that put a damper on the celebration. The greatest disappointment, however, was the prime rib. I ordered it medium rare, hoping for the tender, juicy cut I had previously enjoyed, but it was overcooked and chewy. I only had four bites before resigning myself to the fact that it was not the delightful experience I remembered. Sadly, my birthday dinner didn't meet the high standards set by my first visit.",
        "We (5 of us) went into mcfaddens on 3/19/14 at approximately 7:13, we were sat and 10 mins went by and nobody saw us. I check the time because I'm a server myself and know about seeing people within 90 secs and we were pressed for time because we were going to a concert. So I went up to bar, after another 3 mins the bartender asked what I need and I said no one has seen us and it's been a while. The bartender came out and offered us drinks, I said we needed to order and he promptly took our orders. Unfortunately, the service continued to be slow, and it was clear they were understaffed that night. We finally got our appetizers after about 25 minutes, and while the food was decent, it wasn't enough to make up for the delays. Our entrees took even longer, and we had to rush through them to make it to the concert on time.\n\nThe atmosphere at McFadden's was lively, which was a plus, but it was hard to enjoy it when we felt so neglected. Despite the initial service hiccups, the bartender was friendly and did his best to make up for the delays. Overall, it was a disappointing experience given our time constraints, and it might be best to visit when you're not on a tight schedule. Hopefully, McFadden's can work on staffing to improve their service during busy times.",
        "This is strictly a beer review. Happy hour looks promising though.\\n\\nLooking for a man date or a sporty classy bar to escape the fam bam for a few hours? This Rock Bottom brewery might be a good place start.\\n\\nI came in at noon, and there were 4 pairs of guys drinking beer and watching ESPN highlights. Clearly this is the place to go for the midday work lunch with a good guy friend. Unfortunately the Cardinals got stomped on, so everyone was in a sour mood. The local patrons were at least friendly to hide their disappointment behind camaraderie and laughter. I decided to dive into their beer selection, and I was not disappointed. The house brew, a crisp pilsner, was refreshing and had a nice balance of hops and malt\u2014a perfect choice for both novice and seasoned beer lovers. The IPA, on the other hand, packed a punch with its bold citrus notes and a lingering hoppy finish that was invigorating. While the ambiance was distinctly masculine with its dark wood decor and multiple screens showing sports, the staff was welcoming and knowledgeable, eager to suggest brews that would suit my taste. Although I didn\u2019t stay for happy hour, the promise of discounted pints and a lively atmosphere makes it tempting for a return visit. For beer enthusiasts seeking a casual yet classy setting, Rock Bottom Brewery is a solid choice.",
        "Bank of America was my first bank after switching from a credit union. I banked with them for a couple years. A few months after I turned 18, they told me in the branch that I was approved for a student credit card to be used for overdraft protection. I thought that was great because I was still learning to balance a checkbook and hardly ever had more than $200 in my account at a time. I filled out all the paperwork and the teller said it would be applied right away as a backup.\n\nWell, that didn't happen. A couple of weeks later, I overdrafted my account by a small amount, expecting the credit card to kick in. Instead, I was hit with a hefty overdraft fee. When I returned to the branch to inquire, they couldn't give me a clear answer. This lack of communication and follow-through was frustrating and made me reconsider my banking options. Overall, the experience was disappointing.",
        "Don't go here for your banking. Their customer service is terrible and they are incompetent. I wanted to get away from the big banks because I'd heard that the smaller banks, like credit unions, were better. So far, they are no better. In fact, the customer service at Bank of America was WAY better; at least I could get a live person whenever I needed it. Reaching a live person at the credit union is next to impossible in my experience. My impression is that they prefer that you either take care of what you need through their automated system or wait for an eternity on hold. On top of that, when I finally spoke to someone, they were unable to resolve a simple issue with my checking account. It felt like they were just reading off a script without actually listening to my concerns. I\u2019m extremely disappointed and will be looking to switch my accounts to a more reliable institution.",

        "Sorry. Can't give this place more than 2 stars for a couple reasons. First time I came here, the waitress was really sweet, but forgot to put in my boyfriend's order for a shake, and neither of us were that terribly excited about the food we did receive, especially for the price. Also, I realize it may be hotel policy, but they wouldn't honor our Harrah's comp voucher unless we charged the meal to the room.\n\nSecond time, I go to place a to-go order for a burger and fries. Hostess says I need to wait at the bar to order, which seemed inefficient considering the restaurant wasn't busy. After a lengthy wait, my order was finally taken, but the food was bland and uninspired, and the fries were soggy. The atmosphere is nice, and the staff are friendly, but the service inconsistencies and mediocre food quality just don't match up with the cost. Disappointing overall.",
        "I'd give this company location no stars if possible. On Thursday, March 21, I arrived to pick up a car I'd reserved over a week prior. The king of the Enterprise rental counter, whose name I wish I'd gotten so that I could name and shame him, had a terrible, condescending attitude right off the bat. It's one thing if your reason for not honoring my reservation is some wonky company policy, but it's quite another to talk down to me in a smarmy voice, be needlessly difficult, and act like he's doing me a favor just by speaking to me. His dismissive attitude made an already frustrating situation infuriating. He offered no solutions, and I left without a car, feeling belittled and undervalued. Customer service is clearly not a priority here, and I strongly advise anyone in need of a rental to take their business elsewhere. It's not worth the aggravation.",
        "My cousin and I went to Vegas with a group of friends for Labor Day weekend and well we HAD to get our hair done for the club. So glad dry bars are everywhere now. I found this place on yelp and decided to check it out. It's a fairly new place and less than 10 minutes from the strip. \\n\\nAs soon as we entered, they greeted us and offered us bottled water while we filled out an info card. Very nice and clean place!\\nThey start off by washing your hair and giving you an incredible 5-10 minute scalp massage that instantly puts you in relaxation mode. The stylist was attentive and asked about our hair preferences, ensuring we were comfortable with the styles we chose. I opted for loose waves, while my cousin went for a sleek, straight look. Both styles turned out beautifully, lasting well into our night out. \n\nThe atmosphere was chic with a modern vibe, and the music they played added to the overall fun experience. The staff was friendly and professional, and they didn't rush through the service, which I appreciated. Prices were reasonable, especially considering the prime location so close to the strip.\n\nThis dry bar made our prep for the night out enjoyable and stress-free, definitely a gem worth visiting if you're in Vegas. We'll absolutely be returning on our next trip to make sure our hair is on point for the festivities!",

But I don\u2019t know about being stopped every two seconds by staff members asking if we needed help. It was overwhelming and honestly made us feel unwelcome, like we were under constant surveillance. The store itself is cute and colorful, but the tense atmosphere was a huge turnoff. A little more space to enjoy browsing without feeling like a suspect would have made this visit so much better. We left sooner than planned and probably won't be back.",
        "Awesome hotel, beautiful suites - with bathrooms the size of a typical NYC hotel room, incredible pool deck, great staff, great service, excellent elevators, excellent housekeeping. Front desk could use quite a few more clerks, and while they are very very nice, it would be helpful if they could be both nice and efficient, it took about 6-10 minutes for each check-in.\n\nPool areas are fantastic, heated pools, nice lounge chairs, towels and chair covers, lots of bars (they make a lotta $$ off those $10 cocktails). Despite the small hiccup at check-in, the overall experience was delightful. The rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated, providing a relaxing retreat after a day of exploration. The housekeeping staff deserves a special mention for their meticulous attention to detail. The location is perfect for accessing local attractions while offering a serene escape from the city hustle. With just a little tweak at the front desk, this place would be absolutely flawless. Highly recommend for a luxurious getaway",
        "Oh Modern Grove, you were so pretty - yes, you turned my head and I was draw into your inner sanctum - once again, so lovely - a delightful place to hang out and have a beer - like a little section of hipster Santa Monica brought into the desert - as a bar, I would give you 4 stars, but as a restaurant, I'm sorry to say, all style and not much substance.\\n\\nMore specifically, I ordered the white sauce pizza with the cured ham and the arugula - it sounded good but as I sat down with my slice, I found myself underwhelmed. The crust was unfortunately more chewy than crisp, and the white sauce lacked the depth and flavor I was hoping for. The arugula was fresh, but the cured ham felt sparse, leaving the pizza feeling a bit unbalanced in terms of flavors and textures. While the ambiance was inviting, with its charming decor and cozy nooks, the culinary experience didn't quite meet the expectations set by its chic appearance.\n\nOn the brighter side, the beer selection was impressive and seemed well-curated, offering a range of options that satisfied my quest for a unique brew. The staff was friendly and attentive, ensuring that my glass never ran dry. So while Modern Grove shines as a spot to grab a drink with friends, the food could benefit from a bit more attention to detail to truly match its stylish allure.",
        "Las Vegas is known for The Strip, several miles of massive resort casinos that will do just about anything to catch a visitor's attention. City Center complex is no exception.\n\nThis ultra-modern, sleek design mixed-use area is home to the Mandarin Oriental hotel. Upon entering the MO, guests travel up to the twenty-third floor to the Sky Lobby, a refreshingly unique concept. However, the Tea Lounge is just sort of there by the check-in desk. It has all the charm of a Starbucks kiosk in any lobby in any hotel in any major city in the world. The ambiance feels somewhat disconnected from the luxurious aura of the Mandarin Oriental. While the tea selection is decent and the pastries are pleasant enough, the overall experience lacks distinctiveness. It feels like an afterthought in an otherwise meticulously curated space. This spot has potential, but currently, it\u2019s more functional than it is memorable, which is a missed opportunity given the hotel's reputation.",
        "Conveniently placed close to the airport, rental car service also close by with big rooms that are clean and come with basic needs.\\n\\nI came in with my mother to the lobby where our room had already been reserved, showed proof and was given our two room keys and directions to our room. We took our car around back and was able to park right in front of our hotel room. \\n\\nThe basic room was spacious, with two Queen sized beds, bathroom/shower, TV, refrigerator, of course AC and wi-fi.

The proximity to the airport and rental car service made our arrival and departure hassle-free. \n\nThe room was impeccably clean, and the beds were comfortable, providing a restful night's sleep. We appreciated the thoughtful amenities like the refrigerator and reliable Wi-Fi, which made our stay more convenient. The air conditioning worked perfectly, maintaining a comfortable temperature throughout our visit.\n\nThe staff was friendly and attentive, always ready to assist with any questions or requests. Additionally, the ease of parking right outside our room was a great perk, especially when unloading our luggage.\n\nOverall, this hotel exceeded our expectations, making it an excellent choice for travelers looking for convenience, comfort, and value. We would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting the area and look forward to staying here again on future trips.",
        "Came here with my boyfriend last weekend for a Living Social deal we got, which was a total steal! It was $199 for Friday 3pm - Sunday 1pm in a suite with a King Size bed (plus 100 bucks towards the spa, 2 free breakfast buffets, and 6 free bowling games). Didn't really know what to expect because we've never stayed anywhere in Vegas except for the strip.\n\nOverall, we were pleasantly surprised that this place was pretty nice! The hotel itself is pretty modern and luxurious for the price we paid. The room was spacious and immaculate, with a comfortable king-sized bed and a view that was unexpectedly delightful. The staff were friendly and attentive, making our stay even more enjoyable. We took full advantage of the complimentary breakfast buffets, which offered a great variety of delicious options. The spa credit was a bonus, allowing us to unwind and relax. The bowling games provided an extra dose of fun. We\u2019d definitely return!",
        "Seriously if you have not been here yet - get in your car and get over there. I went because it got good reviews, it was new to me and it was Mexican food which was what I wanted today. Big surprise - fantastic food.\n\nThe restaurant is not in a swanky neighborhood but don't let that stop you. They are in a shopping center that has several other restaurants, some closed, and a sports bar. Look for it because it is not obvious.\n\nFrom the pictures on Yelp, you might think they do not have many tables, but once you're inside, you'll find a cozy, welcoming space that feels like a hidden gem. The service was incredibly friendly and attentive, making me feel right at home. I tried the carne asada tacos, and they were nothing short of amazing - perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. The homemade salsa was the cherry on top, bursting with fresh flavors. This place is authentic, affordable, and absolutely worth the trip.",
        "This is probably one of the most disappointing meals we've had from a chef of this high caliber. Perhaps because the restaurant is newly opened and the menu hasn't been perfected (well, that is still no excuse for overcooking beef)? Unlike the other low-rating reviewer, service was really good for us. Ambiance and table seating and arrangement were also not an issue. The only problem we had was entirely on the food. I like the different tasting dishes but sometimes it felt really disjointed and confused, as if each dish was crafted by a different chef with no cohesive vision in mind. The beef, supposedly the star of the meal, was overdone and lacked the tenderness one would expect from such a place. The flavors didn\u2019t meld together harmoniously, leaving us perplexed rather than delighted. For a restaurant brimming with potential, I hope they refine their culinary approach soon.",
        "This place is 3 stores in one, a restaurant, a bakery, and a meat market. I would give the restaurant 2.5 stars, the bakery 4 stars, and the meat market 5+ stars. I've only eaten at the restaurant once; my Mom and her husband love this place - so on her recommendation, a couple of friends and I went for a prime rib dinner. My friends and I are not young, but we were the youngest people there. No problem, it was 8 pm and we were starving. We each ordered the prime rib dinner which came with soup, potato, and a few sides. The prime rib was tender, but it lacked seasoning, leaving much to be desired. The ambiance was a bit outdated, catering more to an older crowd. However, the bakery was delightful with a wide range of pastries and fresh bread, while the meat market was exceptional, offering high-quality cuts and friendly service. Overall, a mixed experience, but worth it",
        "This is close to my house when I need to pick up something in a pinch, like jasmine rice, soy sauce, or rice vinegar. Being Thai, I find that they lack a lot of Thai ingredients. Mostly pre-packaged curries and bottled sauces, and that's it. However, they do have lots of Korean and Indian items. The produce section is nice, but no kaffir lime leaves or galangal. Lemongrass shows up every now and then. They do have nice fresh veggies (herbs) like garlic, Chinese cilantro, and basil. I appreciate the variety of fresh greens available, and the quality is generally good. The store is clean and well-organized, making it easy to find what I need. The staff is friendly and willing to help if you have any questions. While it may not fulfill all my Thai cooking needs, it's a convenient stop for other Asian pantry essentials. Overall, it's a decent place for a quick grocery run.",
        "I really don't understand why this place has gotten so many stars. It's a weird setup. First, you go in, and stand in line (McDonald's style) to order a burger and drinks. Wait staff are shuffling next to you and jostling to get by. You're standing in line being jostled on one side and have a loud kitchen on the other. You pay for your food. You sit and wait. The burgers weren't great. The meat was gummy and had the feel of biting into some gelatinous gooey meat-like substance. \n\nThe ambiance leaves much to be desired, with blaring music that makes conversation impossible. The fries were overly salty, and the side salad was wilted. The staff seemed overwhelmed and inattentive. For the price, I expected much better quality and service. It felt like a fast-food experience with a gourmet price tag. Save your money and try one of the many other burger joints in town. This one just doesn't deliver.",
        "This is a restaurant that has a lot of potential but right now is veryyyyyyy much missing the mark. First, if you're doing Thai, you might want to commit to the theme. I like football, but if you want to be a sports bar, be a sports bar. If you want to be a Thai restaurant, maybe play some Asian music? Now, on to the service. My girlfriend was given a plate with a hair on it. Probably our waitress\u2019s. Glad I caught it, but you gotta be careful of that sort of thing. Only one waitress for the whole restaurant, buuuut she was doing her best to keep up with tables. The food itself was okay at best\u2014some dishes felt more like an adaptation rather than authentic Thai cuisine. I believe with a more cohesive theme and better staffing, this place could really shine. Here\u2019s hoping they find their footing soon.",
        "The Thunderbird Lounge, inside the Aruba Hotel and Spa on Las Vegas Blvd. between Oakey and Charleston, is classic Vegas, but not in the typical sense. No matter how many old black & white pictures of the Rat Pack and lounge acts they paste on the walls, this isn't a classic trip back to the \"glory days\" of mob Vegas. Try the Plaza or Sahara for true nostalgia. The Thunderbird is more where you'd end up after Vegas stole your money, stole your lady, stole your heart but left your liver. A place where the neon lights flicker with a gritty charm, and the drinks are as strong as the stories exchanged at the bar. The crowd is eclectic, from old-timers reminiscing about their luck-filled yesterdays to hipsters soaking in the vintage vibe. The live music, a mix of local talent and hidden gems, keeps the atmosphere lively and unpredictable. It's the kind of joint where you can lose yourself, or maybe find a piece you were missing",
        "So incredibly pricey! For the price...not sure if it's worth it. Waiter was good and we were seated so that we could look at all the people shopping outside. Our order:\n\nCalamari: Gluten free whaaaaat? But yes, it is! Not super crispy, but definitely nice flavor though slightly bland. Sweet and sour sauce instead of traditional cocktail/marinara. Not bad.\n\nCaesar salad: Very fresh and crispy. For the price of $13 though? It really was a slab of romaine lettuce with a dash of dressing and a sprinkle of cheese. It seemed more like an afterthought than a substantial dish. \n\nOverall, while the ambiance was lovely and the service commendable, the value for money just wasn't there. This restaurant seems to bank more on its location and view rather than the quality or creativity of its dishes. If you're looking to splurge on atmosphere over food, this might be your spot, but otherwise, you might want to explore other options",
        "Overall it is a very nice park to spend time at anytime during the year. The grounds are very well taken care of and well lit at night. I think it is the nicest park I go to that has a roller hockey rink in it. My friends and I like to use the roller hockey rink but we use it to play street hockey. We normally play there either Sunday mornings or nights and Wed nights. If you want to join us and play look up Las Vegas Street Hockey on the Internet. The rink can get slippery due to some sand coming into it from the volleyball sand pit, but it's a minor issue compared to the fun we have. Aside from street hockey, the park offers plenty of amenities including walking trails, picnic areas, and a playground for kids. It's a fantastic place for families to spend the day or for individuals looking to enjoy some outdoor activities. Highly recommend checking it out!",
        "Our first meal in Scottsdale was at Bacon--and interestingly enough bacon seemed to become the theme of our entire trip. Bacon chocolate chip cookies, bacon brittle, bacon-infused vodka, and bacon Bloody Mary's? They're all available somewhere in Scottsdale, but you can find the famous Bacon Bloody Mary here at Bacon.\n\nThis is a cool space for a breakfast spot, with indoor-outdoor seating and lots of light. Our server, who seemed to be a bit overworked since he was the only waiter, was very friendly and welcoming. We were impressed by the creativity and variety on the menu. The bacon flight is a must-try, featuring an assortment of flavors that highlight the versatility of everyone's favorite pork product. The ambiance is laid-back, perfect for starting a day of exploring in Scottsdale. Despite the busyness, our food arrived promptly and the quality was top-notch. Bacon is a unique spot worth visiting, especially if you're a bacon enthusiast looking to indulge in some culinary adventures.",
        "It was my first time in Vegas and I went with my friend John. Now John is a Vegas junkie; usually, he travels out there in November and March every year. He loves hitting the strip during March Madness. Anyway, he had found a deal at his travel agent. He booked us two different deals: one was at Treasure Island, which included airfare. The other deal was two days and three nights at the Stratosphere, free. When you checked in, they gave you 100 dollars in free slot play, 50 bucks cash, and a free buffet.\n\nOur stay at Treasure Island was fantastic, with great amenities and a lively atmosphere. However, the highlight was the Stratosphere. The views from the top were absolutely breathtaking. The 100 dollars in free slot play was a fun bonus, and the buffet offered a delicious variety of dishes. For a first-time Vegas experience, this trip set a high standard. Thanks to John, I'm already planning my next visit!",
        "I visited with my family for an early dinner on Saturday and was very impressed. We were the only ones there so early, and only one other guest arrived while we were eating, so I would say that reservations are not necessary until later in the evening.\\n\\nWe started with a platter of three hummuses - sun-dried tomato, kalamata olive, and black bean, accompanied with triangles of pita and some fresh veggies. The sun-dried tomato hummus was by far our favorite, but the others were delicious as well. The flavors were vibrant and complemented the fresh pita perfectly. For our main courses, we ordered a variety of dishes to share: lamb kebabs, stuffed grape leaves, and a classic moussaka. The lamb was tender and juicy, seasoned to perfection with a delightful mix of spices. The grape leaves were delicate yet packed with flavor, and the moussaka was a comforting, savory indulgence with its creamy b\u00e9chamel topping.\n\nThe service was attentive without being intrusive, and our server was knowledgeable, happily answering our questions about the menu. The ambiance was cozy and inviting, making it a perfect spot for a family meal. The restaurant is clearly a hidden gem, offering both quality food and a pleasant dining experience. Despite the light crowd during our visit, I can see how this place could become a bustling favorite for locals. We left satisfied and eager to return to try more of their enticing menu.",
        "I just had the absolute worst experience checking in. I've been here for 10 minutes and I'm already leaving this review, which I've never done before. Juaquine Lopes at the front desk should be terminated. After waiting in one line for 15 minutes to check in, he opens up a second line telling everyone behind us to go in front of us. I waited another 25 minutes to check in, only to be told by him that I was in the wrong line to begin with and it's my fault (every other person in my line was there to check in as well). His attitude was condescending and unapologetic, which only added to the frustration. A simple acknowledgment of the mistake would have sufficed, but instead, he chose to be dismissive. The lack of organization and professionalism at this establishment is disappointing. I hope management addresses these issues promptly to prevent future mishaps for other guests.",
        "Went to this location this morning because we found some extra cash in the car before work, never will I ever stop at this location AGAIN. Or for McDonald's for that matter. My partner and I walked into the establishment & each ordered a meal to eat inside. We went to go get our refreshments, as we were waiting, three of the employees were staring at us then would look back at each other and laugh. As our food was called, my partner went to go get it. I watched the three younger Hispanic guys watch my partner reach for the tray and yet again giggle amongst themselves. It was incredibly uncomfortable and felt disrespectful. The food was standard for McDonald's, but the unprofessional behavior from the staff completely ruined our experience. We didn't feel welcome and left without finishing our meal. Customer service should be a priority, and unfortunately, this location failed miserably in that department.",
        "So, I have never actually taken the time to sit down and put pen to paper or even a single finger to keyboard for a review. Really, what I'm saying is, I'm pretty lazy, so for me to even write a review, means you should probably heed my statements... or not, it's sort of a free country (still)...\n\nMy wife and I went to \"Down Under\" a few nights ago because a friend of ours had high recommendations. We walked in, sat where we wanted, and were handed two menus, a wine list, and a warm welcome from our server. The ambiance was delightfully Australian-themed, cozy yet vibrant. The menu, filled with authentic Aussie dishes, was a delight to peruse. I opted for the kangaroo steak, which was cooked to perfection\u2014tender and flavorful. My wife chose the barramundi, which was equally impressive, with a delightful mix of spices. Our server was attentive without being intrusive. Overall, \"Down Under\" provided",
        "Okay, I came to this place a lot for karaoke last year. It was fun cause I could take off my shirt and stuff and no one cared. They also had bar bingo which was a sure-fire way to get drunk for under $15. Recently, a lot of friends were raving about the pizza, which I have had a few times before. I remember it being what I call \"bar pizza\". Pizza that is doughy and fluffy, tastes good when you are sober but even better when you are drunk, however at the end of the night, you might find yourself wondering if it was really the pizza or the beer talking. Nevertheless, I decided to give it another go, and I must say, they've upped their game. The crust was perfectly crisp, and the toppings were generous and flavorful. It\u2019s still the perfect companion for a fun night out, whether you're belting out your favorite tunes or trying to win that bar bingo. Highly recommend for a laid-back evening with",
        "Claim Jumper continues to be my all-round favourite restaurant in the US. First time I ate at one in California I was blown away by the portion size (so big that they were serving apples on the plates) and also by the taste of the food. Their prime rib is absolutely delicious, and second favourite of mine is the rotisserie chicken - especially with their barbecue sauce. In fact, if you get any steak there, get that BBQ sauce and slather it on - it's wonderful.\n\nVaried menu, giant portions, reasonable price, consistently excellent service \u2013 what more could you ask for? The atmosphere is warm and inviting, with a rustic charm that makes you feel right at home. Whether you're there for a family gathering or a casual dinner, the staff always makes sure you're well taken care of. Don't forget to leave room for their decadent desserts; the Chocolate Motherlode Cake is a must-try. Claim Jumper truly embodies the spirit of hearty American dining.",
        "Stopped in here on Saturday with G money. The host was pretty cool in finding us a table around the bar so we didn't have to go up and down any steps. Our server, Alysha (sp?) was one of the best servers I think I've ever had. If you've ever been to Applebees before you know the menu is pretty standard, but with a few cool dishes thrown in. The drink menu also has some nice looking selections on it. I'm not totally crazy about fruity drinks but the red apple sangria looked and sounded good. If I had to recommend anything, it would definitely be that. G money tried the classic burger and raved about how perfectly it was cooked. I decided to go with the Fiesta Lime Chicken, and it was deliciously tangy and well-seasoned. Our food arrived quickly, and Alysha made sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive. The atmosphere was lively, yet not too loud, which made it easy to have a conversation. The overall vibe was welcoming and relaxed, making it a perfect spot for a casual night out. We wrapped up our meal with the Triple Chocolate Meltdown, and it was the perfect sweet ending to our evening. Overall, the combination of great service, tasty food, and a chill environment made for a really enjoyable experience. We'll definitely be back!",
        "I've shopped here for years, but had a recent bad experience. Planning a party and ordering the food should not be such a hostile experience. Their ad says they can have the food ready for catering in 2 days, I showed up to order over a week before the event was due--in total 9 days prior. I waited a long time only to be greeted by Emily who was upset her lunch was interrupted (it was 1:30) and I did apologize for taking her away from her meal, but she was clearly not happy. She made us wait longer for her to finish eating, which felt unprofessional. When we finally got to placing the order, she seemed rushed and inattentive, which made me concerned about how they would handle my catering needs. I've always loved their food, but this experience left me questioning their customer service. I hope they address this issue, as their quality and reputation are at stake.",
        "For those of you who only read partial reviews--this review is about Guitar Center as a COMPANY and not this individual location. I admit that outright.\\n\\nI usually give 4s and 5s. I'm one of those people who has positive things to say about just about anywhere...but not here. Don't get me wrong--I have no problem with this individual location. I have been trying to order something site-to-store from the parent company website for three days. First, they advertised it as one price but as soon as it went into my cart , the price mysteriously increased by 20%. I thought it might be a glitch, so I refreshed the page, but the issue persisted. I then spent over an hour trying to reach customer service, only to be stuck in an endless loop of automated messages and hold music. When I finally managed to speak to a representative, they seemed more interested in upselling me than addressing my concerns. The whole experience was frustrating and felt disorganized. I expected a company as established as Guitar Center to have a smoother online shopping process and better customer service. While the in-store staff at this location have always been helpful and knowledgeable, my experience with the corporate side has left a lot to be desired. It\u2019s disappointing to see such a disconnect between the in-store experience and the online service.",
        "Beware Tourist Trap! 5th time in Vegas and this place so far has been the worst experience in service & food quality! \n\n1st star off: Unatentive \"Pretty Princess\" Waitress (other reviewers seemed to have problems with the staff), the \"busboy\" had a better attitude and was 10 times more attentive than her.\n\n2nd star off: Do yourself a favor and save your money and don't order any of their \"signature\" 30+ dollars drink (the daiquiries were laughably weak and tasted more like melted ice with a splash of artificial flavoring). \n\n3rd star off: The food was another letdown. The pasta was overcooked and the sauce tasted like it came straight out of a can. A $25 meal should scream quality, but this was more of a whimper.\n\n4th star off: Ambiance was more chaotic than charming, with loud music blaring, making it hard to enjoy even a conversation",
        "The best buffet in town! We paid $34/person, kinda pricey... at least compared to all the other buffets in town, but it's definitely worth the money. And kids 12 and under pay half ($17), whereas other buffet places, such as Bellagio, you have to pay full price for kids.\n\nThe food selections are great... not too overwhelming like some other places where it has all kinds of dishes for all types of cuisines, but most of them you won't even bother to touch or try anyway. This place has enough selections of well-curated dishes that cater to various palates without going overboard. The carving station is a standout with perfectly cooked prime rib and tender grilled chicken. The dessert station offers decadent treats like mini cheesecakes and chocolate mousse that end the meal on a sweet note. The staff is attentive, ensuring that tables are clean and drinks are refilled promptly. If you're looking for quality over sheer quantity, this buffet is the spot to visit.",
        "CHEAP! STINGY! MISERABLE! \n\nAfter all day of walking around on the Strip, I was starved. We found Fleur by chance as we explored Mandalay Bay. My BF wasn't very hungry, so he chose something from the \"small plate\" section of the menu, which, as it was explained to us, was similar to Tapas style. Since I was very hungry, I ordered \"slow cooked salmon\" from the \"large plate\" section of the menu. \n\nWhen the orders arrived, I was shocked at the portion sizes. My BF's small plate was barely a few bites, and my \"large plate\" was laughably tiny. The salmon was delicious but hardly enough to satisfy my hunger. For the price, I expected more than a meager serving that left me still craving a proper meal. The atmosphere was lovely, but the portions left much to be desired.

(Home of the gourmet TV dinner which I will get to in a moment.)\n\nI got the salad trio with the chicken, quinoa, and kale salads, and it was exactly what I needed. Each salad was flavorful and light, and the ingredients tasted incredibly fresh.

I found him to be a bag of douche of galactic proportions.\\n\\nI suppose this place is OK for average bikes needing average repairs, but when I brought in my road bike for a repair of moderate difficulty for any competent bike shop, because the owner was incapable of doing the repair he chose to insult me by telling me I should sell my bike and get something more appropriate for someone of my physique. \\n\\nAt the moment I'm a little overweight, but here's the facts: every summer I road bike across the state, and I've been doing this for five years without any issues.

So this is what we ordered and shared:\n\n1st dish: Tofu and Soy Chorizo burrito... oh man, this was awesome. The burrito was perfectly spiced and tasty. I'm sure that any non-vegan would have never guessed that this was a vegan dish... it was that good. The chorizo was da bomb! The dish even came with tofu that was cooked to perfection, adding a delightful texture and rich flavor that balanced the spices wonderfully.\n\nWe also tried their Vegan Nachos, which were a symphony of flavors with creamy cashew cheese, fresh guacamole, and a surprisingly tangy salsa that kept us coming back for more. The ambiance was cozy, and the service was attentive, making the entire experience memorable. Highly recommend to vegans and non-vegans alike!",

Even though the place was packed and there was a line out the door, we were seated in less than 10 minutes and the service was excellent.\\n\\nHaving lived in New Mexico for about 5 years, I've learned a lot about green chile. I've also learned that more often than not, when you visit a restaurant serving green chile outside of New Mexico, their idea of \\\"\"hot\\\"\" is what we would call less than mild in NM. So, I wasn't expecting much when I saw green chile on the menu at this bustling little spot. However, I was pleasantly surprised! The green chile here had a kick that was genuinely reminiscent of authentic New Mexican spice. It was rich, flavorful, and perfectly complemented my enchiladas.\n\nThe ambiance was warm and inviting, with festive decorations adding a cozy touch to our holiday meal. Despite the crowd, our waiter was attentive, making sure our drinks were topped up and that we had everything we needed. The menu offered a delightful variety of options, catering to both traditional tastes and those looking for something a bit different.\n\nOverall, the experience was a wonderful surprise. If you're searching for a place that serves up a taste of the Southwest with genuine warmth and hospitality, this restaurant is definitely worth a visit.

The prices are so reasonable! The walk from valet to the lobby check-in to the elevator is accessible and not a journey through a casino or to the other side of the hotel. If you're ready to go out on the town and need a taxi, the bell boy will happily and quickly hail one for you immediately. \\n\\nThe rooms are amazing! Each room feels like a luxurious retreat, complete with modern amenities and elegant decor.

        "This place is a real gem for those who like to geek out or are true history buffs (that would include my son and husband). We took a visit to Vegas with the family and really wanted to check this place out. We got in here with a Groupon which was $48 for the whole family (5 people) plus access to Area 51.\n\nThere are two areas in this exhibit - Area 51 and the National Atomic Testing Museum (NATM). Area 51 is all about extraterrestrial life and aliens. There are cheesy electronic sounds, alien dolls, and some news articles that give it a fun, kitschy vibe, which my son found utterly fascinating. The NATM, on the other hand, offers a captivating journey through the history of atomic testing. The realistic artifacts, detailed narratives, and engaging exhibits shed light on a significant part of history. The staff was knowledgeable and eager to answer questions.

Not being from the area, I am not sure how well priced the groceries are here, but most things seemed pretty over-priced (at least compared to similar grocery stores in the Boston area). I was seriously in shock over the price of the M&Ms. Almost $5 for a small bag?! They have their own President's Choice brand, which was more reasonable than name brands and the items that I tried were quite good. The store was clean, and the staff were friendly and helpful, which made navigating an unfamiliar grocery store much easier. They offered a decent selection of fresh produce, and I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of local cheeses available - a definite perk for a cheese lover like me! The layout was straightforward, making it easy to find everything I needed. I particularly appreciated their ready-made food section, which provided delicious and convenient options for a traveler on the go.

When I arrived the hostess was rude and pretended that I didn't exist until she realized that I wasn't going away. We were sat quite quickly, but it took nearly 15 minutes before our waiter came to take a drink order. I ordered ne of their signature drinks and was pleased when it arrived. Our waiter brought out bread and herb butter, but the butter was nearly frozen and impossible to spread over the cold bread. I was a little taken back by the pricing on the menu, considering the quality of service we were receiving. When our entrees finally arrived, they were lukewarm, as if they had been sitting out for a while. The flavors were bland, and the presentation was subpar for the price point. Throughout the meal, our waiter seemed disinterested and inattentive, rarely checking in on us or refilling our drinks. I had high hopes for dessert but was once again disappointed by a dry, overly sweet chocolate cake that tasted store-bought. Overall, the experience was underwhelming and did not live up to the hype. I left feeling unsatisfied and frustrated, especially considering the cost. I hope they can address these issues, as they have potential, but I won't be returning anytime soon.",

The pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth tender, adding an extra layer of indulgence. The gyoza were crispy and perfectly seasoned, providing a delightful contrast to the ramen.

        "Best Buffet in Las Vegas. Period. My only dislike about this place is the lack of good seafood choices. The sushi was pretty fresh, and the clams/mussels/shrimp bar is a neat and delicious idea. The trout salad, salty fishy crostini, and seared salmon were alright, but the crab left something to be desired. As a huge crab-bie, that was a bit disappointing!\n\nAll that aside, everything else was pretty darn good for buffet food. The Tomato/Corn Risotto was rich and flavorful, and the Angry Mac n' Cheese added a perfect kick. The lamb was tender and cooked to perfection, which was honestly a surprise for a buffet setting.

        "We are staying at the MGM Grand for a conference and I wanted to have my first Thomas Keller experience. Unfortunately maybe I should have waited till I could get to San Fran or NYC. This restaurant is very difficult to find at the Venetian. We arrived at 8:30PM on Sunday night without a reservation and were seated right away, which was nice. \\n\\nSalad choices were disappointing with a chevre chaud served on mixed greens rather than mache, so I went for an endive and watercress with roquefort. Good dressing although slightly overpowering, which overshadowed the delicate flavors of the greens. For the main course, I opted for the roasted chicken, expecting a masterpiece given Keller's reputation. Sadly, it was underwhelming. The chicken was tender, but the seasoning lacked the depth and complexity I anticipated. \n\nMy dining partner chose the beef short ribs, which were much better. They were succulent and well-cooked, paired perfectly with the accompanying root vegetables. The ambiance was pleasant, with an elegant yet relaxed vibe, but the service was hit-or-miss. Our server was attentive but seemed rushed, perhaps due to the late hour. \n\nDessert was the saving grace. The chocolate mousse was decadent and luxurious, a sweet end to an otherwise middling experience.

Windows 7 was corrupt, only a portion of files transferred, and the programs that were on the computer when I purchased it, which is why I purchased that one, are no longer on it. So in addition to paying the $70.00 transfer service, I had to pay another $200.00 to a local technician to try and fix what Fry's had messed up. The customer service was equally disappointing; I was met with indifference and lack of accountability. I expected much more from a reputable electronics store, but this experience has left me frustrated and out of pocket. I won't be returning to Fry's for any future purchases or repairs.",
        "What a disappointment! I went to Aureole Las Vegas for my sister's birthday dinner. I checked it out online and it sounded amazing. She said yes and so VEGAS HERE WE COME!! Saturday night our party of 8 get to what we thought would be a fabulous dinner. We are taken to our table and are rudely greeted by our waiter. He quickly tells us about their wines and walks away. We flag him down and ask for the sommelier. Our waiter comes back after several minutes and takes our drink order. Drinks were great but after that, the service fell apart.\n\nWe waited almost an hour for our entrees. When they finally arrived, some dishes were cold, and others weren't what we ordered. The waiter seemed overwhelmed and uninterested in our concerns. The ambiance was lovely, but the service left a lot to be desired. For a place with such a reputation, we expected more. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype.",
        "Decided to run in here, because it's close, for a quick sushi dinner and afterwards, we wished we hadn't. They were NOT nice to us, it was like we were inconveniencing them, even though there were many many empty tables.\n\nSo... as we are talking with the hostess, working on being seated, some snooty chick comes up, interrupts and says, \"um, we need to be seated NOW.\" The hostess then asks, \"Is your party all here?\" (which is necessary when you reserve a table), but the interrupter just nodded dismissively. To our astonishment, they were immediately taken to a table, while we continued to wait.\n\nWhen we finally got a seat, service remained lackluster. The sushi was forgettable at best, with limp fish and rice that wasn\u2019t properly vinegared. Overall, the experience was a disappointment. The atmosphere was cold, and the service was inattentive. We left feeling unappreciated and uns",
        "Was in Vegas for the weekend for Punk Rock Bowling and wanted to check out the fight. I searched for somewhere showing the fight and came across this $10 UFC viewing party. My group decided to check it out and was very disappointed. For $10 you get to stand in a short line that takes forever because there are security guards frisking you and ruffling through your pockets and belongings. You then proceed to the ballroom where the seats are arranged in a clever circular octagon formation, facing several large screen projectors. It looked cool until you try to find a seat and realize that the space is incredibly cramped. It was nearly impossible to squeeze past people without bumping into them, and the lack of personal space made it uncomfortable to settle in and enjoy the fight. The screens, while large, had a lot of glare which made it difficult to see the action clearly. The sound quality was subpar, too, with echoes and muffled commentary that made it hard to follow what was happening in the matches.\n\nThe saving grace was the enthusiastic crowd, which brought some energy to an otherwise lackluster setup. However, the overpriced snacks and drinks left a sour taste, making the overall experience feel like a cash grab rather than a genuine fan event. For $10, I expected a bit more than just the opportunity to stand in a crowded room. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it unless they make significant improvements.",
        "The Lost Dog Wash Trail and I (as well as Bry and our two labradors) had the pleasure of meeting each other at the end of April. Even at a little after 8am, there was a freak storm hovering nearby so we had some concerns with \"surviving\" the trail and getting back in time before getting fully rained on. To our relief, the hike was easy as pie and had little elevation gain, but we did encounter one small problem. We were talking and missed a turn and ended up adding another trail and a half or so to our loop. Despite our detour, the trail was well-maintained and offered stunning desert views, particularly with the dramatic storm clouds adding a unique backdrop. The signage could be clearer, but the friendly fellow hikers we met along the way were more than happy to help redirect us. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, and our labradors loved every moment, especially the extra mileage!",
        "I didn't stay here, just visited opening weekend to see what it was like... And I was very underwhelmed. The broken elevators and the crowds, definitely expected that kind of thing for opening. There are growing pains.\n\nWhat I didn't expect was the layout and design of this place. It was perfectly \"meh.\" Being the first opening of a major resort and casino since I've moved here, I was excited to see what it would be like. I really didn't like the design, and left confused about how they could have missed the mark so entirely. The decor felt dated rather than fresh and innovative, and the overall ambiance seemed lackluster. Areas that should have been inviting and exciting felt instead like an afterthought. Additionally, the signage was inadequate, making navigation a challenge. For a new establishment, it lacked the charm and excitement that should accompany a grand opening. Hopefully, with time, they\u2019ll tweak and improve the experience, but I won\u2019t be rushing back soon.",
        "The ambiance is lovely and many of the dishes above average but the service was so terrible, it can guarantee you'll have a bad night... so why bother?\n\nEverything started off fine even though the wait for a table ended up not being the \"10 minutes\" they promised but well over 30 minutes. They sit you down and get your order and everything seems fine. And then you wait. Over 45 minutes later, without a peep from our waitress to check in and let us know what is going on, they dump food on our table. \n\nThe food, while good, was not enough to mask the frustration of poor service. We had to flag down staff multiple times just to get water refills or to ask for the check. It was clear they were understaffed, but a little communication would have gone a long way in making the experience more bearable. Sadly, the lack of attention and care overshadowed what could have been a delightful evening.",
        "I won't write much here, as I don't really do franchise reviews...and, actually, I've already written a review for another Sprouts location (or two? I don't remember and can't be bothered to check...). So, if you want a better run down on Sprouts, in my eyes, having shopped there for almost 5 years, please check my profile. For now, this is a quick run down of this location.\n\nOn the downside, some of their stock is different than what we'd grown accustomed to in Salt Lake City. Certain specialty items and local favorites are missing, which can be disappointing for those of us who enjoy consistency. However, the produce section is still top-notch, offering fresh, organic options that make up for it. The staff here is attentive and friendly, ready to help with a smile. Parking is a breeze, which is always a bonus. Overall, it's a solid spot but with minor tweaks needed to match the Sprouts experience I love.",
        "Whoever goes to this place is out of their mind. Depended on Yelp for reviews, and supposedly they do a great job. Spent 300 the night before for a beautiful ombre and decided to go in for a quick small trim to freshen up my hair. Well, now my hair is in a bun because it looks horrible. Money down the drain for the next few weeks until I go and have to spend another 300 for a new ombre since half of mine was cut off. The girl cutting my hair was a really nice girl, but when I called to speak to a manager about the situation, they were dismissive and offered no solution or apology. It's incredibly frustrating to have invested so much in my hair only to have it ruined. I will not be returning and caution others against trusting the reviews. Customer service is clearly not a priority here, and I deeply regret my visit.",
        "I went here tonight with the BF. We thought it was really meh, capital MEH. We had a reservation, but for some reason got sat inside. There were virtually no people eating inside and outside was lively and had a band playing... we couldn't even hear it inside... it was like silent. I would think they would at least open the doors, but nope. So that was a bad start. It took our waitress a long time to even come to our table, and when she came she asked if we wanted drinks and apps (which we didn't given the vibe). The ambiance inside felt like an afterthought compared to the lively atmosphere outside. We ordered entr\u00e9es, hoping the food would make up for things. It was just okay, nothing remarkable. Service was slow, and it felt like we were forgotten at times. Overall, it wasn't the experience we were hoping for, and we left feeling underwhelmed. Not sure we'll be coming back.",
        "Sadly in the year and a half since I first wrote my review things have changed a bit at Cafe, and not for the best. More and more my coworkers and I are experiencing regular problems with this place, that is when we're brave enough to risk ordering from Cafe now.\\n\\nFirstly, there's the problems with the orders. It honestly doesn't seem to matter if we order right off the menu or if we ask for a small change to our order - something basic will always be missing (like lettuce) or done incorrectly when the food arrives.

        "Probably should give this one star, but can't bring myself to go that low. The restaurant offers a huge buffet that is thoughtfully laid out, allowing ample room to maneuver around without bumping into other patrons. The buffet was impeccably maintained; I never saw an empty dish, which was impressive. The staff deserves a nod for their friendliness and efficiency\u2014they were quick to clear plates and refill drinks.\n\nHowever, the food, which is the main attraction, was largely disappointing. The sushi rolls, for example, were overwhelmed by a crab-like slaw; it seemed like every roll came with an unwelcome dollop, masking any subtle flavors the sushi might have had. Other dishes were similarly underwhelming, lacking the freshness and vibrancy you'd expect. Despite the excellent service and buffet layout, the subpar food made it difficult to fully enjoy the experience. It\u2019s a decent place if you prioritize quantity over quality\u2014but unfortunately, it missed the mark for me.",

        "I had been wanting to try this place for some time, knowing that it was esteemed chef Tom Colicchio's restaurant, and the experience was divine. The ambiance was very simplistic, not extravagant, but at the same time very elegant. Our service was excellent as well; the server was helpful with picking out a wine (I think the cheapest wine on the menu was about $44 so be prepared to spend some $$ if you plan on drinking).\n\nThe food itself was fantastic. My only complaint was that our server did not make it clear whatsoever that the portions are quite small. While beautifully presented and bursting with flavor, each dish was more of a tasting portion, leaving us a bit surprised. However, the quality of the ingredients and creativity in each dish made up for it. We particularly loved the seared scallops and the duck breast, both cooked to perfection. Overall, it's a wonderful spot for a special occasion, just be ready to order multiple courses to feel fully satisfied.",

Disgusting food for a ridiculous price! 90 DOLLARS for SIX DISHES!\n\nCame here for lunch before leaving Vegas - and obviously not a good one at all.\n\nWe were a party of 6 adults and 2 children - we ordered 6 dishes:\n\nHouse Steamed Chicken with the ginger onion dipping sauce - there were barely any meat on the chicken - quite frankly it was nearly all bones and more suited for a broth than a meal. The salt and pepper shrimp was overly greasy, making it hard to enjoy. The beef chow fun was bland, while the vegetables looked like they were on life support. Plus, the sweet and sour pork was mostly batter with a whisper of meat. To top it off, the service was slow and indifferent. For the price, I expected at least decent quality. Save your money and your taste buds\u2014find another spot!",
        "I don't understand any decent review for this place. We met 4 other couples and this was a disaster from the beginning. First of all, the decor is hideous. It's in a strip mall, and the furniture was old and dark. The tables wobbled, and you could not walk on the old, worn-out vinyl floor without your feet sticking to the ground. They act as if this is an upscale place (based upon the menu and the prices), however, nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nDrinks...I ordered a captain and diet, and it tasted like club soda. Clearly, there was barely any alcohol, if any at all. When we ordered appetizers, they took forever to arrive, and when they finally did, the wings were cold and soggy. The entr\u00e9es were no better\u2014overcooked and bland. Service was slow and inattentive, leaving us feeling neglected. I cannot recommend this place to anyone. It was a complete disappointment from start",
        "Let me start off by saying I did not choose to have this company attempt to fix my clothes dryer; they were contracted by my home warranty. My trouble started last December. On 12/19/11, my dryer broke. My warranty company contracted Avalon for the repair. On the 23rd when I still hadn't heard anything from them, I called their office. I was informed they never received any notification from the warranty company. After going back and forth for a couple of hours, they scheduled a service appointment for the 28th! (Had to take time off work.)\n\nThe technician arrived late, lacking the necessary parts and tools. He promised to return the next day but didn\u2019t show up until January 3rd, again without the right parts. After multiple frustrating calls, the dryer was finally fixed on January 10th. The lack of communication and professionalism was disheartening. If I had the choice, I\u2019d look for a more reliable repair service.",
        "I've driven past this place many times and always made a mental note to try it out. I had a sushi craving today and thought why the hell not?\n\nThe good: I walked in and was impressed by the decor. It was warm and inviting and the hostess was nice.\n\nAnd that's where it ends.\n\nThe bad: I was seated and sat there for a good five minutes before I was even approached by a server to take my drink order. 3 of them walked right past me multiple times. And there were only a handful of tables occupied, so it wasn't even busy. When my server finally arrived, they seemed rushed and uninterested in answering my questions about the menu. The sushi, when it eventually arrived, was mediocre at best, lacking the freshness I anticipated. The rolls were loosely packed and fell apart upon picking them up. Overall, the lackluster service and subpar food left me disappointed, and I'm not sure I'll be returning anytime soon.",
        "Am a little late on this update as it's about our Fathers Day Brunch experience and that was a few weeks ago but still felt compelled to type. Went to brunch with my wife, her sister, and their parents. The brunch menu was pretty extensive and covered an App, Entree, and Dessert for $35.\n\nFirst good news. Not being a dessert person, I asked if I could sub two apps instead of one app and one dessert. \"It's Father's Day, sir, absolutely no problem.\"\n\nSecond good news. Just about everyone at the table raved about their meals. The Eggs Benedict was perfectly cooked, with a rich, creamy hollandaise, and the seafood risotto was a standout, packed with flavor and generous portions of fresh shrimp and scallops.\n\nThe service was warm and attentive, making us feel special on this occasion. The ambiance struck the right balance between being lively and intimate, perfect for a family gathering. All in all, it was a memorable brunch that left us",
        "When we got here there was a lot of people waiting and we checked in and sat down within 15 minutes. Not bad for a full restaurant. Once we were seated, our very attentive waitress Mary came and it was like 'BANG BANG BANG.' Seriously, she was good! She got our drinks, took our orders, brought us banana nut muffins, and about 10 minutes or less later, our food was out at our table. How awesome was that? They are really organized, or the cooks are secretly Superman or have some sort of secret powers. The dishes were piping hot and beautifully presented, bursting with flavors that delighted our taste buds. The atmosphere was lively and inviting, making it a perfect spot for a casual dinner or a special occasion. Overall, the experience was seamless, and the staff clearly knows how to manage a busy restaurant without compromising on service or quality. Highly recommend giving this place a try!",

        "This review is strictly for purchase of a Christmas tree. I was pretty set on getting our tree from another store because it was a steal but they had run out and my heart was sad. So me and my family were on a mission to find our perfect Christmas tree, without spending a fortune on doing so.\n\nFor whatever reason, I thought I was going to be stuck shopping at a Christmas tree lot to get our tree. It never crossed my mind to come to a Nursery to get a Christmas tree but when we found out my sister-in-law got hers from Green Haven Nursery, we decided to give it a shot. The selection was surprisingly vast, with trees of all shapes and sizes, and prices that were quite reasonable. The staff was incredibly helpful, assisting us in finding a tree that would perfectly fit our living room. The whole experience was delightful, and the fresh pine scent has our home feeling like the holiday season is truly here.",
        "I usually try to write only positive reviews of places or companies, but lately I've come across one too many bad doctors in this valley and fed up, felt compelled to describe my experience here at PHG. \\n\\nUnfortunately, it differs greatly then that of most of the other reviews. It is those other reviews that convinced me to try this place. I guess not everything works for everyone, but I wanted to share my personal experience.\\n\\nCompletely unimpressed with this place and Dr. Majidi. From the dingy exterior of the building to the chaotic reception area, my experience at PHG was less than ideal. The staff seemed overwhelmed, and I waited nearly an hour past my appointment time before being seen. Once inside, the consultation with Dr. Majidi felt rushed and impersonal. There was little empathy or interest in addressing my concerns, and I left feeling like just another name on a chart rather than a valued patient.\n\nThe lack of communication and attentiveness was disappointing, especially given the glowing reviews that initially drew me to this practice. I understand that healthcare providers are under immense pressure, but a little kindness and professionalism go a long way. Perhaps others have had better luck here, but my visit to PHG was frustrating and unproductive. I hope that they can improve their service to match those glowing reviews and provide a more positive experience for future patients.",
        "This store automatically gets only one star because the worst sales associate I have ever come across has transferred from the CL store at the Palazzo to this one. I don't know her name but she's a tall, older lady with short dark hair and a European accent who has a scowl on her face at all times. She's not knowledgeable, helpful, or friendly at all and makes me feel extremely uncomfortable. Who wants to get the death stare while they are shopping or even shopping at ANOTHER store right across the way (which she has done to me multiple times)? Her presence casts a shadow over the entire shopping experience. The store itself has a decent selection, and the other staff members seem pleasant, but her negative energy is overwhelming. It's disappointing because I used to enjoy shopping here, but until there's a change in staff, I\u2019ll be taking my business elsewhere. Avoid if you can.",
        "Unusual for a Vietnamese restaurant, I hold this place to the same standard of cleanliness I expect from a Chinese restaurant: if it tastes good and doesn't make me sick, it's a-okay! I have grown up in Asian restaurants and really, despite all the negative reviews, this place isn't that scary! If you're looking for ambiance, well, maybe you should save this one for another day. I can't say I've ever been to a Vietnamese restaurant where the decorations blew me away. However, if you are craving some mighty decent Vietnamese cuisine, you should definitely give this place a try. The pho is flavorful, with a broth that's both rich and aromatic, and the banh mi is packed with fresh, crisp ingredients. My personal favorite is the lemongrass chicken \u2014 it's tender and perfectly seasoned. The staff is friendly and attentive, making sure your water is always topped up and your needs are met. Prices are reasonable, and portions are generous, ensuring you leave with a satisfied belly. While the decor might not win any design awards, the food certainly makes up for it. So, if you can look past the modest interiors, you're in for a delightful culinary experience that will transport your taste buds straight to the streets of Vietnam. Don't let the negative reviews deter you; sometimes the best gems are hidden in the most unexpected places!",

So what better way to get together with some of his climbing friends who had also moved out west of the Mississippi? Meet up at the Red Rock Rendezvous!\n\nA weekend of climbing clinics, swag, and events sponsored by Mountain Gear to raise cash for the Access Fund... we quickly realized it was 80% socializing and 20% climbing, but we loved every minute.

The clinics were insightful, and we picked up some handy tips, but it was the camaraderie and the stunning backdrop of Red Rock Canyon that truly made it unforgettable.

I used to be obsessed with Paradise Bakery but then I met Wildflower and so I dumped them. The reason? Their ingredients! So fresh, so delicious! I've literally had everything on their menu and there is nothing that I wouldn't recommend. Isn't that hard to admit when it's not your mom's food you are having? Well anyways, another thing I love about Wildflower is that they are always giving back to the community. A few months ago, I attended one of their charity events where they donated a portion of their proceeds to a local food bank. It\u2019s rare to find a restaurant that not only serves amazing food but also prioritizes community involvement. The staff at Wildflower Bread Company are always welcoming and attentive, making each visit a pleasant experience. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, perfect for a quick lunch or a relaxing dinner. My personal favorite is their roasted sweet potato salad\u2014it\u2019s a perfect blend of flavors that never disappoints. Whether you're in the mood for a hearty sandwich, a fresh salad, or one of their delectable baked goods, Wildflower has something for everyone. I'm thrilled to support a business that values quality, community, and customer satisfaction. If you haven't tried Wildflower Bread Company yet, you're truly missing out on a hidden gem.",

They invited me to Chang's for lunch where I met them. They explained to me how it worked, but they did all the ordering because I would probably order some weird stuff. \n\nNow, I don't know the names of any of the stuff I ate, so I'm going to try and describe it as best as I can. We had these delightful little dumplings filled with what tasted like shrimp and some kind of green herb. Another dish was a fluffy, white bun that had a savory, sweet pork filling \u2013 mind-blowingly good! There was also a crispy spring roll that was perfectly golden and crunchy. Overall, the variety and flavors were amazing, and the experience was both fun and delicious. I can\u2019t wait to try Dim Sum again!",
        "I would consider myself a Whole Foods Market super fan from Michigan to North Carolina to Arizona. They are generally where I find foods I love. It's where I do most of my \"healthy\" shopping. I usually will only shop at other stores when I can't find what I need at a Whole Foods.\n\nThe Chandler, AZ location stands out for several reasons. Hits: Nice selection of bulk dry items, allowing me to buy just the right amount I need. The veggies and fruits are consistently fresh and high-quality, perfect for my daily smoothies and salads. I also love stocking up on spices for cooking; they have a diverse range that keeps my meals exciting. The store is always clean, and the baskets are well-maintained, which is a small but important detail that adds to the shopping experience.\n\nOverall, this Whole Foods location keeps me coming back time and time again for its quality and variety.",
        "I'm not one to overindulge, but when I am desirous for an adult beverage, I want the best. It was a gift for a colleague that led me back to the spirits purveyor, that until now, was always a pleasure to visit.\n\nFar from expert in my knowledge of Canadian whiskey, I was hoping an experienced staff member of this shop might help me select the best. Unfortunately, the feeling I got was akin to interrupting a brain surgeon at work--although this one was operating on cardboard with a box cutter. Brusque and seemingly annoyed by my presence, the staff member offered little more than a grunt and a vague gesture toward the whiskey aisle. Left to my own devices, I made a guess and hoped for the best. The shop still boasts a wide selection, but a touch of customer service would certainly enhance the experience. I left feeling more like a nuisance than a valued customer, which is a stark departure from my previous visits.",

So my wife and I drove to Brossard to check it out.\n\nThe restaurant is laid out very unusually, its half a bar, pizza place and the other half is the breakfast side. When you first arrive we thought we entered the wrong place, because it was a pizza joint with no server present. Once we walked through the pizza place we entered the side of the breakfast place where some random waiter said \"ya just sit anywhere\". The food was so-so, lacking the excitement that the blog had promised. My eggs were overcooked, and the pancakes were dry. My wife's omelette was decent but nothing to write home about. The coffee was average, not the aromatic blend we hoped for. The ambiance was confused, and the service, though friendly, felt haphazard. Overall, it was an underwhelming experience, and not worth the drive.",

But let me tell ya, when you walk in there is an immediate change of heart as soon as you see the fountain waterfall in front of you. \\n\\nIt sets the tone for a serene and inviting atmosphere, transforming any preconceptions with its unexpected elegance. The interior is tastefully decorated with soft lighting and cozy seating, making it a perfect spot for a festive gathering. The menu was a delightful surprise, offering a diverse selection of dishes that catered to every taste.\n\nOur group savored a variety of appetizers and entrees, each more delicious than the last. The staff was attentive and friendly, ensuring our glasses were never empty and our needs were promptly met. Our bar manager's recommendation was spot on; the creative cocktails were a highlight, perfectly complementing the flavors of our meal.\n\nIn a strip mall setting, this restaurant delivers an experience that rivals fine dining establishments. It's a hidden gem worth discovering, especially when many places are closed for the holidays. We'll surely be coming back for more memorable meals and impeccable service.",
        "The food was fresh, well prepared and delicious. The service was friendly and attentive. Not a fan of the ambiance, but I'm not there to eat the decor.\n\nI went on a Saturday night around 6pm; it was busy but not packed. I had samosas and they were freshly made, crispy on the outside and tender inside with a little spice. I tried the Szechuan chicken, basically fried chicken pieces with onion, green peppers and hot peppers which again were freshly made, crispy outside and tender inside.\n\nI was looking for a place that offered authentic flavors without compromising on quality, and this place delivered. The spices were perfectly balanced, adding just the right amount of heat without being overwhelming. Although the interior could use a bit of a facelift, the food more than makes up for it. The portions were generous and reasonably priced. This is definitely a spot worth visiting if you prioritize flavor and quality over aesthetics. I'll be back for more!",
        "The first time I came here, I recognized the lady working the counter was the lady who worked at Jenni Pho. I can't comment on the pho as my favorite dish is the dried vermicelli salad. I also ordered their 3-bean dessert. It was a good first experience which deemed for a second trip.\n\nMy second visit was not as good. Because it was a work day, I decided to use the drive-through; however, when I got to the drive-through, there was a sign that said \"come inside to see the menu.\" This was slightly inconvenient as I was in a rush, but I decided to give it another shot. Inside, the service was slower than my first visit, and the staff seemed overwhelmed. Unfortunately, my dried vermicelli salad didn\u2019t have the same fresh flavor I remembered. However, the 3-bean dessert was consistent and delicious. I'll give them another chance, hoping this was just an off day.",
        "I used to love coming to Mimi's when I would be in town visiting family. It used to be crowded and we'd have to rush to beat the line. Sadly those times are done....I will not be back!\\n\\nWhen we got there at 6pm the place was empty. Score!?! No, its empty because it has majority gone down hill. We had 4 people and split 2 dinner for 2s and we got the baked brie also. Regarding our 5 appetizers: baked brie bleh (better not melted and not enough bread), house salad was limp and uninspired, and the calamari was chewy and overly greasy. The main courses were no better. The chicken was dry and the seasoning was overwhelmingly salty, while the pasta was bland and overcooked. It felt like the dishes were thrown together without any thought or care.\n\nThe service did nothing to redeem the experience; our server seemed disinterested and rarely checked on us. Even getting a simple water refill felt like a chore. It\u2019s disheartening to see a place I once cherished fall so drastically in quality.\n\nThe ambiance, which was once warm and inviting, now felt tired and neglected. It's clear that Mimi\u2019s is a shadow of its former self. There are too many other dining options in the area to settle for mediocrity. Unfortunately, the fond memories I had at Mimi\u2019s are just that\u2014memories. I won\u2019t be recommending or returning to this spot anytime soon.",
        "I went here with the high hopes that it will be my new favorite place since there are great positive reviews about it. Sadly, my hopes were all shattered :( Service: if I could give a negative star, I would. We were seated right away at the bar, but then, it had been at least 10 minutes, and no one had taken the initiative to give us a menu or offer a drink. My boyfriend ended up getting a menu himself up front. After that, still nothing. So I asked the chef at the bar (I think he's the owner), and he seemed completely uninterested in helping us. It was a busy night, but the lack of attention and care was unacceptable. The food, once we finally ordered, was mediocre at best, and not worth the long wait. I wanted to love this place, but the poor service overshadowed everything else. I won\u2019t be returning anytime soon.",
        "This place is a F N joke!!! I took my car to the Henderson shop to get an oil change and on my car, there is a plastic cover on the bottom that you have to take off to get to the oil filter. The lazy mechanic took it off and never put it back. And I just changed my air filter, and they tell me it needs to be replaced\u2014WTF. They claim they put in a synthetic blend oil\u2014Yeah, right. DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR THERE!!!! I should have known. I will never again take my car to these losers. \n\nTheir lack of professionalism and attention to detail is appalling. A simple oil change shouldn't result in missing parts and unnecessary upsells. I regret not researching better before choosing this shop. For the sake of your vehicle and peace of mind, find a reputable place that will treat your car with care and honesty. Avoid this shop at all costs!",
        "I ate here last week. I initially enjoyed the ambiance, the nice wait staff, and the wide selection of sushi, robata, and cocktails. However, our food and drinks were littered with inedible garnishes. One of our drinks contained inedible wood sticks and leaves, while the plate came with a side of hollowed out crustacean appendages.\\n\\nWhile I understand that the harvested tree parts add to the flavor of the drink, the crustacean carcases added nothing to the plate other than to disgust their customers. It was a disappointing distraction from an otherwise promising meal. The sushi was fresh and the robata skewers well-cooked, but these unnecessary embellishments took away from the dining experience. The presentation seemed overly focused on theatrics rather than enhancing the flavor or aesthetic value of the dishes. \n\nThe wait staff was attentive and tried their best to explain the concept behind these additions, but it still felt excessive and pretentious. I appreciated their effort to elevate the dining experience, but the execution fell short of the mark. \n\nDespite these setbacks, the restaurant has potential. If they dial back on the unnecessary garnishes and focus more on the quality and simplicity of their dishes, it could be a fantastic dining destination. Until then, I might think twice before revisiting, unless they make these changes.",
        "I had mentioned to my boyfriend that I needed to renew my eyeglass prescription, and he mentioned the deal America's Best had where you can get an eye exam and 2 pairs of glasses, including the lenses, for $69.99. I needed contacts as well and when I called the store, I specifically asked if there was a way to get both the eyeglass and contact lens exam for an additional cost. The woman on the phone told me for $79.99 I could have both the eyeglass exam and contact lens exam, so just $10 more. \n\nWhen I arrived at the store, the staff was friendly and prompt. The eye exams were thorough, and the optometrist took the time to explain my results, which I appreciated. Although the selection of frames was somewhat limited, I did find a pair I liked. The checkout process was smooth, and they honored the pricing discussed over the phone. Overall, I left satisfied with both the service and the value",
        "We dined here this evening with my daughter's dance studio being located in the same plaza. We were both super excited to get a Greek place nearby and had waited anxiously since we saw the signage up prior to opening. It was pretty disappointing, I am sad to say :(\n\nWe had to wait about 5 minutes at the counter to place our order and finally, I think one of the owners, came over to assist us in our order. We waited almost 40 minutes for one gyro plate and one souvlaki plate although they did bring out soup samples, which was a nice gesture. Unfortunately, the wait wasn't really worth it. The gyro was dry, and the souvlaki lacked the robust flavors we were hoping for. The tzatziki sauce, however, was fresh and tangy, which was a redeeming point. The ambiance was warm and inviting, but the service and food quality didn\u2019t live up to expectations. We might give it another try in the future, but for",
        "I was in Las Vegas a couple of weeks ago for work. On Friday night we went out for a group dinner at Enoteca. I have never been to this establishment but having been to Carnevino and having a WONDERFUL dinner I had expectations.\n\nEnoteca is a bit more casual and low key than Carne and offers pastas, pizzas and a small variety of entrees.\n\nOur group started with a selection of cheeses, Prosciutto di Parma and fried squash blossoms. Not being a huge fan of squash, I was pleasantly surprised by the crispiness and flavor of the blossoms. The cheeses were rich and paired perfectly with the savory prosciutto. For the main course, I opted for the spaghetti alla carbonara, which was creamy and indulgent without being overly heavy. The smoked pancetta added a depth of flavor that was truly satisfying. Our server was attentive, keeping our glasses filled and ensuring our needs were met. Overall, Enoteca provided a delightful dining experience that perfectly balanced",
        "OWNERS - STAY AWAY FROM THEM!!!!!!!!\\nRead the other reviews. They are all true. This company could care less about you and your tenants. I will not even go into my long long list of problems because they have an excuse to justify everything that they do to people. Look at how much time the owner spends responding to complaints on this site. He does not know how to say \\\"\"I am sorry, I did not service your account correctly, let me fix it\\\"\". Instead he puts 100% of his effort into laying blame at everyone else's feet and deflecting any responsibility. The communication is atrocious, with emails going unanswered for weeks and phone calls rarely returned. When they do respond, the tone is often dismissive and condescending. Their lack of professionalism is astonishing, and it's clear they prioritize their bottom line over client satisfaction. Maintenance requests are either ignored or handled poorly, leaving tenants frustrated and properties in disrepair. I've heard stories of people waiting months for simple fixes, only to be met with more excuses.\n\nThe owner\u2019s arrogance is palpable, and it's reflected in how the business is run. They seem to thrive on conflict rather than resolution, and any attempt to address concerns is met with hostility. Do yourself a favor and find a company that values integrity and accountability. Save yourself the frustration and potential financial loss. Your sanity and your tenants will thank you.",
        "Shocker folks, I don't normally like hot dogs. The only way you can hand me a hot dog I'll actually eat is if it's fresh off the grill. With loads of ketchup...and I DO mean loads, like buckets full! If I ever think of eating a hot dog without ketchup, the world may end. The world kinda did tonight...a little.\n\nI ordered the New York Dog and the Sweetbread Dog, plus the duck fat fries to split with my friend. I had to order the NYC Dog because I love me some classic street food vibes, and it did not disappoint. The combination of sauerkraut and spicy mustard was a surprisingly delightful departure from my usual ketchup fixation. The Sweetbread Dog was a rich, indulgent experience, with flavors that were simultaneously savory and sweet. The duck fat fries were crispy perfection, adding an irresistible crunch to our meal. Overall, this place has changed my hot dog game. Who knew I'd find hot dog nirvana?",
        "If I could post zero stars, that's what I would do. Let me preface this with the fact that we got here at 7pm on a Saturday...busy time for sure, but a restaurant should be able to forecast for that. After placing our orders, our waiter lets me know that I got the last order of brisket available (again, it's only 7pm on a Saturday). Next, our food comes and here's where the real fun starts. My mom's pulled pork looks chopped (as opposed to actually pulled) and it's DRY AS the Sahara Desert. She could barely swallow a bite without reaching for her drink. Meanwhile, my brisket, supposedly the last precious portion, was lukewarm and lacked any semblance of flavor. The sides were forgettable at best, and the service, though friendly, couldn't compensate for the kitchen's failings. For a place that boasts about its 'authentic BBQ', this was a colossal letdown. Never again. Save"
