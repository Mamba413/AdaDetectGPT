        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told. \"There is no doubt that when the",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy at",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and you need to stick to them.\" BHA media spokesman Robin",

But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand. The panel found she had \"acted in an inappropriate way\" and ruled it was professional misconduct. During the hearing, the mother-of-three pleaded to save her \"very rewarding\" career.",

The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London.

The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT.

Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings by establishing alternate crewing at stations with some specialist appliances.

The bill's passage through the Senate is less certain, reports the BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, as half its members are appointed. But this could happen as early as next week and would almost certainly provoke further protests. Advocates of the bill say it will draw a line under the political turmoil that resulted from the military coup in 2006 that removed Mr Thaksin from power, leaving Thailand bitterly divided.

At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said.

The Uber app connects customers and nearby drivers using GPS technology and gives an estimate of the fare. It generally charges lower fares than traditional firms and drivers rely on technology for navigation. Transactions are cashless using pre-registered bank details. TfL says the consultation seeks to \"raise standards across the industry\" following an \"exponential\" growth in the private hire industry and technology. Uber said it was a deliberate target and if the proposals went ahead they would raise prices and increase congestion in London. Gareth Mead, from Uber, said: \"If you think that this is supposed to be a public consultation, well I think the public",

Burton came close when Stuart Beavon tricked his way into Walsall's box but fired into the side-netting. Wigan's win over Bury means Albion's lead at the top is cut to two points, with Walsall staying in fourth.

There are now almost half a million votes to send the singer to the secretive communist nation. The contest, which ends at 0600 on 7 July, saw North Korea move from 24th to 1st place in less than two days. Many of the votes are thought to originate from imageboard website 4chan, which has built a reputation for triggering online viral campaigns. The voting site is not endorsed by Mr Bieber's record label. Given the fact that almost all citizens of North Korea are denied internet access and there are restrictive controls over all media, it is unlikely that any of the votes have actually come from within the country. A spokesman for the North Korean Embassy in London told BBC News that any application for 16-year-old Bieber to tour would be dealt with by its mission to the United Nations, although the matter would be referred to Pyongyang.

Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are taking part in a pilot scheme following the study. Coercive or controlling behaviour became a criminal offence last year. The research found that although most domestic abuse incidents were handled in a \"professional\" way, some officers still displayed \"negative and uninformed\" attitudes. In particular, police tended to neglect cases where suspects did not use violence but tried to control their victim in other ways such as by making threats. The report said: \"A tendency for the police to focus on physical violence and what has occurred at the current incident can result in them missing abuse which is characterised not by physical violence and injury but by continuous coercion and control in other forms.\" The researchers concluded that if risk was not assessed properly some cases would \"slip through the net\".

Caroline De Wolf, of the Antwerp World Diamond Centre, estimated the haul at $50m, saying: \"What we are talking about is obviously a gigantic sum.\" Earlier reports suggested the figure was even higher - with the Belgian state broadcaster reportedly putting it at 350m euros ($468m). AFP quoted an unnamed spokeswoman at the same Antwerp centre calling the robbery \"one of the biggest\" ever. She said that the diamonds were \"rough stones\" being transported from Antwerp to Zurich. Antwerp is the hub of the world diamond trade - about 150m euros' worth of stones move in and out of the city every day, the spokeswoman added.

Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury.\n\nThe court heard that the collision occurred during adverse weather conditions, significantly impacting visibility and road grip on the rural route. Mr Hicks was a passenger in the van at the time of the incident, which saw his vehicle struck by the oncoming Audi.

        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an **Islamic veil as a sign of extremism.** Critics argue this latest prohibition, alongside other restrictions, further infringes upon the religious freedom of the Uighur minority. Human rights groups warn that such measures risk escalating tensions. Beijing, however, maintains these policies combat extremism and ensure national security. The ban highlights the growing divide between Beijing's anti-terror narrative and Uighur demands for religious freedom.",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Doumen, have recently faced scrutiny over similar pre-race treatment protocols. The BHA maintains stringent rules to ensure fair competition and horse welfare, strictly limiting what can be administered to horses in the hours leading up to a race. While the substance in question for Galilieo Gold was not specified, the presence of anything beyond hay or water, even if accidental, constitutes a violation.

But the number of job vacancies dropped by 18,000 to 745,000, the ONS added, marking the first fall for almost a year. David Freeman, a senior statistician at the ONS, said: \"The employment **picture continues to show resilience, with more people in work than ever before, pushing the employment rate to a new record. However, the first fall in job vacancies in nearly a year indicates a potential easing in labour demand. This mixed bag of data suggests the labour market, while still robust, might be starting to cool slightly, which could have implications for wage growth and inflation expectations in the coming months.**\"",
        "Taibu, 32, played 28 Test matches and 150 one-day internationals for Zimbabwe prior to retiring in 2012. \"When he explained who he was I thought it was a hoax,\" Hightown publicity officer Nick Gordon said. \"The conversation developed, we got references from people in the game in Zimbabwe and we've talked ever since. It's a real coup for us.\" The wicketkeeper-batsman could make his debut for the Second Division side when they play Alder on 24 April. Speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside, Gordon said Taibu approached the club after relocating to the UK and seeking to continue playing cricket for enjoyment. The former international, now settled locally, wanted to find a competitive environment away from the professional spotlight. Gordon emphasized the immense value Taibu brings: \"His experience will be invaluable, not only on the field but also in mentoring our younger talent. It's an incredible boost for Hightown.\" The unexpected signing has generated significant excitement, with the club and fans eagerly anticipating his debut.",
        "The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as \"fuel shortage in a film\", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 tweets. A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries. An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies, causing significant disruption and long queues nationwide.\n\nIn their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. The irony is poignant, as \"Total\" also names a major French multinational oil and gas company. This trending online dialogue highlights public frustration and the surreal nature of the ongoing fuel crisis, blending real-world anxieties with cinematic references.",
        "Among them was a 17-year-old stopped at Sydney airport a fortnight ago, said Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Mr Dutton said there was a \"growing threat\" from Australians attempting to join groups like Islamic State (IS). Special anti-terror teams were installed in Australia's eight international airports in August. The teenager, who was on his way to the conflict in the Middle East, was returned to the custody of his parents while investigations continued, said Mr Dutton. The interception came about a week after two Sydney brothers, aged 16 and 17, were stopped at the same airport, also reportedly attempting to travel to the Middle East. These incidents highlight the escalating challenge for Australian authorities in preventing radicalised individuals, especially minors, from joining overseas conflicts. Minister Dutton emphasised that the new airport anti-terror teams are crucial in intercepting potential foreign fighters. He urged families and communities to remain vigilant against online radicalisation, which poses a complex national security threat.",
        "The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Friday. It now goes to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has warned that the passage of the bill will trigger street protests. It did not take part in the vote, but the bill passed by 310 votes to 0. The bill's passage through the Senate is less certain, reports the BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, as half its members are appointed. But this could happen as early as next week and would almost certainly ignite widespread public outrage, potentially paving the way for the contentious return of exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Critics argue this blanket amnesty, championed by the ruling Pheu Thai party, is a thinly veiled attempt to whitewash past corruption charges and political violence, rather than foster genuine reconciliation. The Democrat Party\u2019s warning of street protests underscores the deep societal divisions. The looming Senate vote is a critical juncture, poised to either exacerbate Thailand's political fault lines or, against all odds, offer a path to fragile peace.",

        "Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilizing effect, leading to short-term volatility rather than sustainable development. He argued that long-term green investments, like renewable energy infrastructure, could provide the steady, patient capital emerging markets desperately need. These projects offer predictable returns and address climate risks, making them ideal for channeling global savings. Carney reiterated his call for Germany to leverage its G20 presidency to establish frameworks encouraging this vital flow, ensuring both environmental protection and global financial resilience.",
        "Gene Palmer is the second prison worker detained over the jail break. Joyce Mitchell has already been charged with aiding the escape. The prisoners, Richard Matt and David Sweat, used power tools to flee the Clinton Correctional Facility. A massive manhunt is still under way to find the pair, both convicted killers. Mr Palmer has been held on bail, after appearing before a judge on charges of promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence, and official misconduct. His lawyer, Andrew Brockway, admitted his client delivered the meat but said he did not know it contained the tools, nor that the **tools were for an escape. This arrest deepens the scandal surrounding the three-week-old breakout. The massive multi-agency manhunt continues across northern New York for Matt and Sweat. The incident raises serious questions about prison security and potential staff complicity. Authorities urge public vigilance, emphasizing the dangerous nature of the fugitives as the relentless pursuit continues.**",
        "The party's election manifesto said a funding floor would only be introduced after a referendum was called. The St David's Day Agreement had said the vote would be an \"expectation\", and Labour Welsh ministers oppose a referendum before a funding deal. Labour accused the Tories of trying to hold them \"over a barrel\". The manifesto states the Conservatives would \"introduce a 'funding floor' to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament\". But a Welsh Conservative spokeswoman told BBC **News their position ensures certainty by linking the funding floor to a referendum on income tax powers. She stated the vote is crucial for greater Welsh autonomy and fiscal accountability.**\n\n**This creates a political impasse. Welsh Labour prioritises stable funding *before* any income tax devolution vote, to protect public services. The Conservatives, conversely, see the referendum as the necessary prerequisite for their funding guarantee and a logical progression of fiscal powers. This highlights deep divisions over Wales's financial future and the path to further devolution.**",
        "Hibs were hammered 10-1 on aggregate by Bayern Munich, while City lost 3-1 to Eskilstuna United from Sweden. \"I think it is fantastic for Scottish football that we actually have two teams in the Champions League,\" Signeul told BBC Scotland. \"It just shows that what we have done has actually brought us two spots.\" Signeul pointed out that the Netherlands, who will host the Euro 2017 finals and play Scotland in a 20 October friendly in Livingston, only have one team in Europe's top club competition. \"It is all based on rankings and what **clubs achieve in European competitions over a period of years,\" she added. This dual representation, despite the significant aggregate defeats for both Scottish clubs, underscores the remarkable strides made by the women's game north of the border. Signeul believes the experience gained, even in challenging encounters against top European sides, is invaluable for player development. This progress is crucial as Scotland prepares to face the Netherlands in a friendly, showcasing the nation's rising footballing stature.**",
        "It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another example of that in the capital when oBike launched. It is a company backed by considerable venture capital and it's putting hundreds of hire bikes on London's streets. The company aims to have thousands in the capital by the end of the summer, after already operating huge schemes in South East Asia. The big difference compared to the existing cycle hire scheme is the bikes have no docking stations. A locking rear brake means they can be left anywhere. The app-based system allows users to locate, unlock, and pay for rides seamlessly, promising unparalleled flexibility. However, this innovative model also presents challenges. Local councils have voiced concerns about potential pavement clutter and the management of abandoned bikes. Despite this, oBike joins other dockless bike operators like Mobike and Urbo, signalling a significant shift towards a more fluid, on-demand urban mobility landscape. This trend positions London as a key testing ground for disruptive transport, aiming for more efficient and sustainable city travel.",

Their best results came when reaching the quarter-finals in 1996 and 2012, a tournament they co-hosted with Equatorial Guinea. During this year's Nations Cup, which also saw Equatorial Guinea step in as late hosts, Gabon's selection marks a return to the spotlight for the central African nation. Their ambition to win the trophy on home soil will be driven by stars like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

Predominantly male, the \"superfans\" are also more likely than most consumers to buy music on CD or as downloads. The results came from a survey of 504 UK residents, who had attended at least one festival in the last year. According to ticketing website Eventbrite, which commissioned the survey, these \"superfans\" help to \"drive the music festivals market\", often recommending music and events to their friends. They account for 28% of all festival-goers, a crucial market segment.\n\nTheir substantial annual spending and clear preference for premium experiences like VIP access underscore their commitment to the festival scene. Eventbrite further emphasizes their vital role as influencers, actively recommending events and artists within their social circles.

        "The were 37 crimes recorded in Cromer over the weekend - including the rape of a teenager - with residents linking them to a group of travellers. Suffolk Constabulary said it warned Norfolk Police about the group ahead of its arrival on Friday. Norfolk confirmed it was made aware and said it was reviewing its response. Suffolk officers said they told their Norfolk colleagues about the group after it was issued with a local authority notice to leave Lowestoft on Friday afternoon. The notice had been served after a number of incidents of disturbance in the town. Norfolk confirmed it had been told but said there was \"no specific intelligence to suggest a heightened risk of serious crime that would warrant a proactive police operation.\"\n\nThis statement has ignited fierce criticism from local residents and politicians, demanding clarity on why a heightened police presence was not deployed given the prior disturbances. A spokesperson for Norfolk Police indicated that their ongoing review would thoroughly examine \"the information shared, our assessment process, and subsequent deployment decisions.\" Community leaders are now calling for urgent meetings with police and local authorities to address the growing public safety concerns. The incident has intensified the debate around inter-force communication and the effective management of transient groups, with further updates expected as the police investigation progresses.",
        "The A320 pilot reported seeing a white quadcopter drone \"flash past\" the aircraft while travelling south of Brookmans Park last August. No avoiding action was possible due to the lack of available time, a UK Airprox Board report said. It concluded a \"collision had only been narrowly avoided and chance had played a major part\". Air traffic control said the A320 pilot reported that \"something had just gone over the top of him\" at about 18:45 BST on 15 August 2016 while flying north of Potters Bar. The controller said another aircraft had just crossed above but confirmed no other commercial traffic was present, leading to the strong suspicion it was a drone. The incident, a Category A Airprox, underscores the escalating danger from rogue drone operation in controlled airspace. Authorities warn drone users about strict regulations near airports and above 400 feet, citing potential catastrophic consequences. Such near-misses highlight the urgent need for better detection and greater public awareness to prevent future hazards and ensure aviation safety.",
        "A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave. This concerning trend, revealed by research from the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM), highlights deep-seated issues within the workplace. The ILM attributed the low uptake to \"ingrained\" attitudes among employers, coupled with significant financial worries among new fathers who felt they simply could not afford to take time off.\n\nLast year, the government announced upcoming changes, effective April 2015, which will allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave. However, the ILM's findings cast a shadow over these reforms. The institute explicitly stated that its research strongly suggests these legislative changes will have minimal impact on fathers' leave patterns unless the prevailing attitudes of employers are fundamentally addressed and shifted. Without a cultural change, the new provisions may remain largely unused.",

They must do so to the sound of a single drum beat. This year all music must stop 43 metres away from the church so there is no music within earshot of it. A planned residents' protest has also been restricted to a maximum of 50 people at two locations. The Orange Order has said it is appalled by the determination. \"The commission is now simply a mouthpiece for republican propaganda, allowing them to dictate the terms of legitimate cultural expression,\" a spokesperson stated.\n\nThe controversial determination, issued by the Parades Commission, aims to manage tensions surrounding the traditional Twelfth of July march. These stringent conditions seek to balance parading rights with local residents' concerns in a historically contentious area.

The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but his family believe that injuries on his body showed that he was murdered. An assessment was done of \"all information known\" regarding the death after contact between his family and chief constable Phil Gormley. Police said the review had included tracing and speaking to people who were in Wick the night Mr Mcleod died, but who had not previously come forward. Mr Mcleod's mother, June, told BBC Scotland last month that if the **case was not reclassified as murder, she would never give up her fight for truth and justice.**\n\nThe thorough police review, initiated following the family's relentless campaign, has now concluded. Despite new witness testimonies being gathered, authorities have yet to officially alter the accidental death ruling, a decision that has deeply disappointed the Mcleod family.

The pair died in their sleep aboard a boat on Windermere in April 2013. Mr Eteson, 42, from Hale in Greater Manchester, denies the charge. The family had gone to the Lake District for the Easter bank holiday weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday. But on the afternoon of 1 April, Mr Eteson removed the generator from the deck and used it to power a 1kW fan heater to heat the sleeping quarter, prosecutor Jacob Dyer, told the court. He alleged this action led to a lethal build-up of carbon monoxide in the boat's cabin. Kelly Webster and her daughter, Lauren, were found unresponsive the next morning, having succumbed to the fumes. The prosecution argues Mr Eteson showed \"flagrant disregard\" for safety, failing in his duty of care. The trial continues, with expert testimony on generator use and boat safety anticipated.",
        "NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood groups in an emergency. It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups. The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said that these specific blood types, especially B negative and Ro, are more prevalent in people of Black heritage. This makes donations from these communities incredibly important to provide the best treatment for sickle cell patients, who often need regular transfusions. NHSBT is urgently appealing for more Black and minority ethnic donors to ensure a compatible and sufficient blood supply for all, highlighting the life-saving impact of their donations.",

It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of \u00a34.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra \u00a332m for the DEL, announced recently, may offer a lifeline for the wider education sector and potentially alleviate some broader financial pressures.\n\nCritics argue that while the additional DEL funding is welcome, it does not directly address the targeted removal of the \u00a31.1m premium, which disproportionately impacts the smaller, specialist college. Concerns remain that without this specific support, the institution\u2019s unique provision and viability are at risk, despite the overall increase in departmental funds. Stakeholders are urging the Minister to reconsider the premium's withdrawal given the college's vital role and the severe implications for its future operations and student services.",

Monmouth MP David Davies told BBC Wales S4C was a \"special case as it promotes the Welsh language\". Ministers have said S4C should aim for similar cost savings as the BBC. On Thursday, Labour warned that cuts to the BBC's budget threatened S4C, but Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told MPs there was a commitment to the channel \"within the next couple of years\", and he hoped to have discussions with its management in the near future. This commitment, however, leaves the channel's long-term funding model uncertain, especially given the pressure for cost savings across public broadcasters. Concerns persist that imposing similar cuts as the BBC might compromise S4C's distinctive role in promoting the Welsh language and culture.

        "The Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1) blasted off from the Naro Space Center at 16:00 (07:00 GMT). Science Minister Lee Ju-ho said the satellite, which will collect climate data, was in its correct orbit. The launch comes weeks after North Korea used its own three-stage rocket to place a satellite into orbit, sparking international criticism. South Korea's 140-tonne rocket, known as Naro, was built in partnership with Russia, which had agreed to work with Seoul for three launch attempts. Analysis: What is driving North Korea's increasing space ambitions? While Pyongyang frames its launches as peaceful, many see them as tests for ballistic missile technology. This successful third attempt for South Korea, after two failures, is a significant milestone. It not only advances Seoul's scientific capabilities but also subtly asserts its technological independence and growing influence in a region marked by intense rivalry.",

        "A report from British Marine, which represents the leisure, superyacht and small commercial marine industry, said superyacht revenues for the year to April 2016 had reached \u00a3605m. Revenues for the whole sector rose 1.6% to \u00a33.01bn, the first time the \u00a33bn mark has been breached since 2008-2009. However, the report predicted growth would slow during 2017. It said uncertainty over Brexit negotiations was likely to curb demand. Total revenue fell in the wake of financial crisis, reaching its lowest point in the financial year 2011-2012 of **\u00a32.54bn**. This recent rebound, with the sector exceeding the \u00a33 billion mark for the first time in seven years, signals a robust recovery from the post-financial crisis downturn. The strong performance of the superyacht segment, contributing over \u00a3600 million, underscores its vital role in the industry's overall health.\n\nHowever, the optimism is tempered by the looming uncertainty surrounding the UK's departure from the European Union. British Marine's forecast for 2017 suggests a deceleration in growth, as potential trade barriers, fluctuating currency, and reduced consumer confidence are expected to dampen demand for marine products and services. The report emphasizes the need for clarity in Brexit negotiations to safeguard the sustained prosperity of this significant economic contributor.",
        "The deal unveiled by Russia on Thursday to set up four \"de-escalation zones\" is backed by Turkey and Iran. But the main Syrian opposition grouping says it has little faith in the deal. Elsewhere in Syria, activists say government aircraft have hit central Hama province, and there are reports of shelling and gunfire in other parts. The opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC), said on Friday the safe zones plan lacked \"safeguards and compliance mechanisms\". It also said it did not accept Iran as a guarantor of the deal. The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, cautiously welcomed the initiative, stressing the need for robust implementation and humanitarian access. The agreement, forged in Astana, aims to halt fighting in key areas including Idlib and parts of Homs. However, the HNC's deep skepticism highlights persistent challenges in achieving a political resolution. Past ceasefires largely collapsed, leaving millions displaced. Despite continued international efforts, this latest plan faces significant hurdles, casting doubt on its long-term effectiveness amid ongoing military operations.",

You are going to do something about that, right?\" Mr Trump did not challenge the man's assertions. His campaign later stated he was merely acknowledging the questioner. Yet, Ms Clinton and others swiftly condemned his inaction as a tacit endorsement of Islamophobia, fueling division and concern.",
        "He's also having to get used to the media and laying out his policies - many of which are quite distinct from the previous leader's. Mr Corbyn has been highly critical of the government's response to the Calais migrant crisis and says the UK must do more. He told me: \"These are human beings, these are people in desperate situations - they need our help and they need our support. \"There's a very large number of people going over to Calais to take aid and support to them - we should be part of the European programme both for Syrian refugees and other refugees.\" His views mark a significant departure from the government's stance, advocating for a more compassionate and collaborative European effort on migration. Beyond this, Mr. Corbyn's leadership signals a clear shift towards renationalisation of key industries and an end to austerity measures, contrasting sharply with the previous Labour leadership and the current government. These bold policy positions are now central to Labour's redefinition, presenting a distinct alternative for the country and setting the stage for intense political debate as he navigates the media spotlight.",
        "The bodies of backpackers Miss Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, and Mr Miller, 24, from Jersey, were found on a beach on Koh Tao in September 2014. Burmese bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun were found guilty of the killings in December 2015. An appeal court in Thailand upheld the death sentences handed down to them. Lawyers for the two men now have 30 days to appeal to the Supreme Court - Thailand's final court of appeal. The pair's mothers lodged appeals at Koh Samui court last May over concerns about the judgements, in particular **DNA evidence reliability and torture allegations. The controversial case faced international scrutiny over investigative and trial fairness. The defence maintains their innocence. The Supreme Court appeal is their final legal avenue, with a verdict keenly awaited by all concerned.**",
        "That amount is equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, the report by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) said. The divide between the most peaceful and the least peaceful nations was deepening, the annual report added. Iceland is the world's most peaceful nation, whilst Syria is the least. Libya saw the most severe deterioration over the course of 2014, according to the Australia-based IEP says. The Middle East and North Africa now ranks as the world's most violent region, overtaking South Asia which received that ranking. This staggering figure represents the global cost of violence, highlighting the immense economic burden of conflict. The IEP's findings underscore a worrying trend of escalating instability and deepening divides, driven by ongoing conflicts and the rise of extremism. The report emphasized that the Middle East's descent into violence is largely due to the protracted crises in Syria and Iraq. Urgent global cooperation is needed to address these critical challenges and foster greater peace.",
        "Falcon and Pointer was fined \u00a3175,000 for making automated calls about PPI, and Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd was fined \u00a350,000 for asking to speak to people's dead relatives. Both companies claimed the calls were made by a third party. Anne Jones, Assistant Commissioner for Wales, said it sent a \"clear message to callous cold-callers\". She said: \"It increasingly appears from our investigations that Swansea is the UK's cold-call capital. \"Companies in the city have been trying to cash in using ruthless business models based on illicit practices to make illicit profits. Falcon and Pointer's fine targets automated PPI calls, while Direct Choice was penalised for insensitive calls about deceased relatives. Third-party claims rejected.

Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton were sacked despite using \"reasonable force\" against the unidentified patient, said the Prison Officers' Association (POA). But Mersey Care Trust, which runs Ashworth, said the evidence meant sacking the pair was its only option. More on this story and other news from Merseyside and Cheshire The dispute at the unit, one of three high security hospitals in England and Wales, began at 07:00 GMT. Steve Gillan, the General Secretary of the POA, condemned the decision as an \"outrageous betrayal,\" asserting the nurses acted in self-defence. He called for their immediate reinstatement. The industrial action, involving a significant number of staff, is disrupting non-essential services at the high-security facility. Mersey Care Trust insists a thorough investigation led to the dismissals, prioritising patient and staff safety. Negotiations are anticipated as the dispute continues.",
        "Charles Blackman's oil work Women Lovers features two nude women resting on a bed beside a cat. Art broker Mossgreen tried to promote it on Facebook, but the social media network rejected it for \"advertising adult products or services\". Mossgreen chief executive Paul Summer said the decision was \"ridiculous\". \"This is a very beautiful image that is not overtly sexual in any shape or form,\" he told the BBC. \"It's like going back to the 1950s. It's ridiculous to censor this sort of thing.\" Facebook said its decision was final, although Mossgreen has since expressed its deep concern over what it perceives as an alarming trend of censorship by tech giants. The gallery highlighted that the painting, a significant work by a celebrated Australian artist, is part of a public exhibition, not an adult service. Critics argue that such broad-brush content moderation stifles artistic expression and fails to differentiate between art and pornography, raising questions about who dictates cultural norms online. The incident underscores ongoing tensions between social media policies and the art world.",
        "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, set at the height of the Cold War, is being adapted by the Oscar-winning writer of Slumdog Millionaire, Simon Beaufoy. It follows Alec Leamas, a hard-drinking British intelligence officer whose East Berlin network is in tatters. Le Carre said he was \"very excited\" by the show, which will appear on BBC One. The series will be another co-production with US network AMC, following their joint effort on The Night Manager. Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie and Olivia Colman all delivered standout performances in that previous hit, setting a high benchmark for this new espionage thriller.\n\nJohn le Carr\u00e9's classic novel, renowned for its gritty realism and moral ambiguity, delves deep into the psychological toll of Cold War espionage. Beaufoy's involvement suggests a fresh yet respectful approach to the source material, promising a nuanced portrayal of Leamas's desperate mission and the shadowy world of betrayal. Fans are eager to see how this iconic spy story translates for a contemporary audience, building on the success of recent high-quality BBC/AMC collaborations. The series is expected to capture the novel's tense atmosphere and intricate plot, further cementing Le Carr\u00e9's legacy.",
        "OUP analysed more than 120,421 short stories by children aged between five and 13 years old, submitted to the BBC's 500 Words competition. According to the OUP, new technology is increasingly at the centre of the children's lives but how they are writing about it is changing fast. Words including email, mobile and Facebook are in decline, it said. They are being replaced by the likes of Instagram, Snapchat and emoji. And the word television has now been superseded by phone. The report also notes a sudden new arrival in children's sentences. The use of the hashtag symbol # to categorise ideas or express emotions is now prevalent.\n\nThis rapid linguistic evolution underscores the profound influence of social media on young minds, with their vocabulary directly mirroring the fast-paced digital world they inhabit. The findings offer critical insights into how technology shapes their communication and storytelling, reflecting a constant adaptation to new platforms and modes of interaction.",
        "The 23-year-old Heracles forward claimed he was waiting to finalise a move to the Championship club. Slade insisted there was no truth to the reports but admitted he did have some interest in the player \"some time ago\". \"To my knowledge that's not something we're going to pursue,\" he said. Netherlands Under-21 international Weghorst began his career with FC Emmen before joining Heracles in 2014. Heracles chairman Jam Smit believed a fee had been agreed with Cardiff for Weghorst, who has also been linked with Celtic. \"I think all parties were close to an agreement,\" Smit stated, expressing surprise at the Bluebirds' manager's comments. \"We had a figure in mind that we believed Cardiff was willing to meet.\" Weghorst, a towering striker who netted 12 goals last season, has drawn significant European interest. Despite Slade's denial, the saga surrounding the promising forward's future remains unresolved, leaving fans and pundits speculating on his next destination.",
        "The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars associated with bacterial presence, will indicate if an antibiotic prescription is necessary. If the infection is viral, patients will be advised on self-care, avoiding unnecessary medication. This initiative is crucial in combating antibiotic resistance, a growing global health threat, and freeing up GP capacity. However, pharmacy bodies warn that without adequate government investment, the expansion of such vital community services faces significant hurdles, potentially undermining their long-term success and the NHS's ability to innovate.",
        "The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a \"growing threat\", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, located 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant, is also close to Kagoshima, a city of 600,000. Sakurajima's last deadly eruption was in 1914, when 58 people died. The Japanese archipelago, which sits on the Pacific \"Ring of fire\", has more than 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima regularly spews ash and there are many small explosions there each year, with scientists now warning of a potential for a large-scale, explosive eruption within the next 30 years. Their study, published in Scientific Reports, suggests a significant accumulation of magma beneath the volcano, indicating an increased likelihood of a major event. This heightened activity raises significant concerns for the residents of Kagoshima and the critical Sendai nuclear plant. Authorities are urged to enhance monitoring and preparedness plans to mitigate potential risks.",
        "The girl, who has Smith-Magenis Syndrome, was arrested four times and twice held overnight in police stations. Her mother complained about her treatment to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). Sussex Police said it welcomed the IPCC scrutiny and supported its inquiry. The girl came into contact with police between 2 February and 2 March last year in Horsham, West Sussex. She was held under under the mental health act on 9 February, arrested on suspicion of assault seven days later, held over a public order offence on 29 February and arrested in connection with criminal damage on 2 March. Her mother, who wishes to remain anonymous, expressed profound distress over the repeated detentions, arguing her daughter's complex needs were not adequately understood or accommodated. Smith-Magenis Syndrome can cause significant behavioural challenges, making standard police procedures potentially traumatic. The family hopes the IPCC investigation highlights the critical need for enhanced training and protocols within police forces when dealing with individuals with learning disabilities, ensuring their welfare is paramount. This case underscores a broader call for improved mental health and disability awareness across law enforcement.",
        "PC Frances Tilley admitted she had \"destroyed her career\" after evading payment for a journey between Bristol Temple Meads station and Castle Cary in Somerset last June. A disciplinary hearing at Northamptonshire Police headquarters heard she was less than two years into her job and was still on probation. She was dismissed for gross misconduct. The hearing at Wootton Hall heard Tilley travelled from Northampton to Castle Cary on 22 June last year. The officer, described as \"diligent, professional and committed\", was travelling with friends and did not buy a ticket for the final leg of her journey.\n\nDespite being described as \"diligent\" and \"professional,\" the panel concluded her actions constituted a serious breach of public trust, leading to her dismissal. Northamptonshire Police stated such behaviour is incompatible with an officer's duty. Her case highlights the stringent integrity required from all police personnel, demonstrating that even minor infractions can lead to career-ending consequences when public trust is involved.",

But the recent coup attempt in Turkey means she cannot work \"under the radar\" any longer, she said. Ms Miller, 40, a mother-of-three from Cinderhill in Nottingham, said her Kurdish husband supported her work but she did not always tell him the full story until after she had returned. \"I don't deal directly with the slavers - but **I liaise with trusted intermediaries who negotiate their release,\" she explained. Her perilous missions, often funded through personal savings, have seen several women rescued from horrific conditions. However, the increased scrutiny and instability following Turkey's failed coup have made her clandestine operations significantly more challenging. Miller expressed deep concern for the trapped victims, fearing that heightened political tensions will further complicate rescue efforts. She remains determined to continue her vital, dangerous work, stressing the urgent need to bring these women to safety.**",

        "Officers at first did not treat Stephen Phillips's death as suspicious after he was found in his Wolverhampton flat. His family, however, grew suspicious upon discovering two mobile phones were missing from the property. Further investigations and forensic tests proved conclusively that Mr. Phillips had been struck before he tragically fell, sustaining the fatal injury.\n\nThis critical evidence led to the arrest and subsequent conviction of Lewis Thornton, 24. Thornton has now been jailed for 10 years for Mr. Phillips's manslaughter and robbery. Mr. Phillips, a 54-year-old father of six, died from a severe head injury on March 11, 2015, at his home on Dudley Road, Blakenhall. The court heard he had been punched in the head during the robbery, which ultimately led to his death. This tragic case highlights the devastating consequences of violent crime and the pursuit of justice for victims and their families in the Birmingham and Black Country area.",
        "Mrs Foster said on Wednesday that she wanted to better understand those who love the language. She said she wanted to \"listen to and engage with those from the Gaelic Irish background, those without the party political background\". Mr \u00d3 Muilleoir said he hoped the meeting would happen soon. \"It's a positive move,\" he said. \"Anything that encourages dialogue, that encourages conversations, that encourages increased understanding has to be positive.\" Stormont's parties have \"paused\" talks to strike a deal to form an executive until after Easter. The parties have yet to find a deal that would restore devolution.\n\nMrs Foster's comments signal a potential shift in her Democratic Unionist Party's approach to the Irish language, a key sticking point in power-sharing negotiations. Sinn F\u00e9in, whose representative Mr \u00d3 Muilleoir welcomed the outreach, has consistently called for an Irish Language Act as a prerequisite for restoring the Northern Ireland Executive. This initiative, if successful, could help bridge a significant cultural and political divide, fostering reconciliation and potentially unblocking the path to a new executive at Parliament Buildings.",
        "Midfielder Arteta, 32, had a bony spur removed from his left ankle, which the club said has been causing him \"significant discomfort\" for months. Defender Debuchy, who just returned from three months out with an ankle injury, had an operation on a shoulder he dislocated in the win over Stoke. Boss Arsene Wenger described Debuchy's injury on Sunday as \"unbelievable\". \"It's very unfortunate,\" said the Frenchman. \"It's unbelievable because he's had two surgeries in the same season. He just came back, he played seven games before this latest setback. Both players now face extended periods on the sidelines, dealing a significant blow to Arsenal's ambitions. Arteta's absence leaves a void in central midfield, while Debuchy's recurring injury woes severely deplete options at right-back. Wenger's squad, already stretched, must now contend with these fresh setbacks as they push for a Champions League spot and compete in the FA Cup. The double injury blow highlights the mounting pressure on the club's medical staff and the depth of the squad as the season enters its crucial final stages.",

The FTSE 100 share index hit fresh 11-month highs before falling back and closing scarcely changed at 6,680.69, that is a slight fall of 2.17 points or 0.03%. The more UK-focused FTSE 250 index rose 68.75 points, or 0.4%, to 16,775.14. The property sector - which saw significant investor concerns post-referendum - showed signs of recovery. Major real estate investment trusts (REITs) recorded modest gains, indicating a tentative rebound. This suggests investors are cautiously reassessing the economic outlook, finding potential value in oversold assets. While long-term commercial property investment still faces headwinds, the day's trading hinted at returning resilience. The broader market's positive momentum, particularly Sterling's strength and the FTSE 250's rise, underscores a growing, albeit fragile, confidence in the UK economy, slowly permeating into volatile areas like real estate.",
        "The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of \"buildings as power stations\". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel \"skins\" which create cavities between the outer facade and the building's structure. These cavities capture and circulate solar-heated air, providing renewable warmth and hot water, drastically cutting energy bills. The ultimate goal is to make structures fully energy self-sufficient, even generating surplus to feed into the national grid. This innovative approach promises a future of sustainable construction, significantly reducing carbon footprints and fostering widespread energy independence.",

Detectives found the bodies in what they described as a squalid, vermin-infested home. On Friday Ms Murray pleaded not guilty to all charges. Those include foetal death concealment, witness intimidation and permitting substantial injury to a child. Her lawyer said he believed she suffered with mental illness. \"You want answers in circumstances like this... mental illness doesn't always provide those kinds of answers,\" Ms Murray's lawyer Keith Halpern said.\n\nThe grim discovery at the Blackstone residence has sent shockwaves through the quiet Massachusetts community. Police, who have not yet publicly identified the bodies or their ages, are continuing their meticulous investigation, including forensic analysis of the scene. The welfare of the surviving children, reportedly four, has become a primary concern, and they have been placed in state care. Ms. Murray is currently being held without bail, awaiting further court proceedings. The case highlights the complex and often tragic intersection of public safety concerns and mental health challenges.",
        "The care at Stafford Hospital left some patients drinking water from vases, it is claimed, and receptionists assessing emergency cases. Julie Bailey, who set up the campaign group Cure the NHS after witnessing her mother's treatment, was made a CBE. Helene Donnelly, a nurse who became a whistleblower, was made an OBE. Figures suggested there were more deaths than would have been expected at Stafford Hospital between 2005 and 2008. Patients needing pain relief either got it late or not at all, leaving them crying out for help, and there were cases where food and drinks were left out unreachable for vulnerable patients. These shocking allegations, detailed in multiple reports, pointed to catastrophic failures in fundamental care at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. The subsequent public inquiry, led by Robert Francis QC, exposed a culture of neglect and understaffing. This scandal prompted significant national reforms within the NHS, fostering greater transparency, accountability, and patient safety across all trusts. The events at Stafford Hospital remain a stark reminder of the critical importance of vigilant, compassionate healthcare provision.",

Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargoes without guarantees that port fees will be paid. However, creditors, banks and the South Korean government are all reluctant to put up the cash. The global economic downturn, fierce competition and falling prices has hit profits across the cargo shipping industry and Hanjin collapsed with debts of about $5.4bn (\u00a34.1bn) last month. There are an estimated 89 Hanjin ships out of its 141-vessel fleet in limbo, unable to unload their valuable cargo. This has trapped an estimated $14 billion in goods, severely disrupting global supply chains. Retailers and manufacturers are scrambling for alternatives, facing costly delays. The crisis underscores the shipping industry's precarious state, raising fears of broader economic fallout and potential further insolvencies in the struggling sector.",

        "The proposals are believed to include tougher English language requirements for students. Dominic Scott, head of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, said it would be a \"nail in the coffin\" for recruiting overseas students. The Home Office has argued there are no limits on numbers of genuine students. Universities have already been lobbying ministers to remove overseas students from migration targets - but the new English language proposals, if they were given the go-ahead, would mean even an higher threshold for entry. Universities argue that overseas students are increasingly important to the UK economy and that raising more barriers sends out a negative signal globally. Critics contend such measures would deter talented individuals, impacting not only university finances but also the UK's soft power and future international collaborations. This pushback highlights a significant tension between the government's immigration objectives and the education sector's economic and academic interests. The debate continues, with universities stressing the long-term detriment of such restrictive policies on a vital revenue stream and the nation\u2019s global standing.",

African Union (AU) leaders are due to discuss the crisis in Burundi at a summit in Ethiopia. They want Mr Nkurunziza to accept peacekeeping troops to prevent Burundi sliding into ethnic conflict, but analysts say he is unlikely to accept the proposed 5,000-strong AU force. Nkurunziza rejects foreign intervention as an \"invasion.\" The AU deems deployment crucial to avert full-scale civil war and ethnic violence.

        "Charles Mumbere, the king of Rwenzururu, is entitled to these privileges because he suffers from hypertension and diabetes, it added. But prison authorities say an outsider will not be allowed into the prison to prepare his meals. The king was arrested last month after a security force raid on his palace in western Uganda's Kasese district. More than 80 people were killed in the clashes. The 64-year-old monarch denies any involvement in violence. He was arrested with more than 150 people, including royal guards. His lawyer, Caleb Alaka, told the BBC he will vigorously challenge the serious charges of murder, terrorism, and treason leveled against his client. The king's health, particularly his dietary needs, has become a key concern for his legal team seeking special provisions. This high-profile case, stemming from escalating tensions between the kingdom and the Ugandan government, continues to draw significant local and international attention to the volatile region.",
        "These beautiful pictures are the first ever taken of a wild lioness nursing a cub from a different species - an extremely rare event. The pair were spotted by Joop Van Der Linde, a guest at Ndutu Safari Lodge in Tanzania's Ngorongoro Conservation Area. The scene is the Serengeti; the attentive mother, five-year-old Nosikitok. The lioness has a GPS collar fitted by Kope Lion, a conservation NGO, and three young cubs of her own - born around the 27-28 June. Dr Luke Hunter, **President of Panthera, a global wild cat conservation organization, called the event \"absolutely extraordinary.\" He explained that while lions occasionally adopt cubs of their own kind, interspecies nursing is virtually unheard of in the wild. The healthy cub was reportedly accepted, perhaps due to Nosikitok\u2019s recent birthing making her more receptive. While the cub's long-term survival in a lion pride is uncertain, this unprecedented interaction offers a unique glimpse into complex maternal instincts. KopeLion continues to monitor Nosikitok, hoping to learn more about this remarkable display of cross-species care.**",
        "Evha Jannath, 11, was on a school trip on Tuesday when she fell from a circular boat on Splash Canyon at Drayton Manor. Alton Towers and Legoland Windsor are among those to have closed similar water-based white knuckle rides. Drayton Manor said it would remain closed on Friday for health and safety investigations. Latest on this and other stories from Staffordshire Merlin Entertainments, which runs Legoland and Alton Towers, said it had closed the following rides: A spokesperson said that on learning of Tuesday's fatal fall at Drayton Manor, they immediately took the precautionary measure of closing their own water rapids rides. Alton Towers confirmed the temporary closure of its Congo River Rapids, while Legoland Windsor similarly shut down its Pirate Falls Treasure Quest.\n\nThe tragic incident, which saw Evha pulled from the water but later pronounced dead, has prompted a joint investigation by Staffordshire Police and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).

        "The holders, who also won the trophy in 2013, bowed out in the group stage despite six wins in 14 games. Promotion in the County Championship, though, is still a possibility. \"We wanted to be in a position going into the last five games where we had something to play for, and we have,\" Ripley told BBC Radio Northampton. \"We'll be pushing hard to get ourselves in there with maybe two games to go, one game to go. \"I'm just looking forward to seeing us get stuck in and who knows, it could still be a pretty special **end to our season,\" Ripley concluded.**\n\n**Despite their cup elimination, the county side\u2019s full attention has now shifted to securing promotion in the County Championship.

The team is determined to finish the season powerfully, aiming to clinch that coveted promotion spot and transform a mixed campaign into a memorable success.**",
        "The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday. The one-year lending rate will also be reduced from 6% to 5.6%. On Thursday figures showed China's factory output contracting for the first time in six months. Economic growth slowed to a five-year low of 7.3% last quarter. Many economists had expected China to stimulate economic growth through fiscal spending rather than lowering rates. To offset the effect of lower rates on savers the bank said it would give banks the flexibility to offer higher deposit rates, up to 1.2 times the benchmark rate. This unexpected People's Bank of China (PBOC) move signals deep concern over the economy. Aimed at lowering borrowing costs, it boosted Chinese stocks but pressured the yuan. Analysts anticipate more stimulus, including further rate cuts, as Beijing prioritizes growth to avert a sharper slowdown.",
        "The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so called \"bearer bonds\". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy clients to potentially hide assets. \"We are cooperating with the authorities in these investigations,\" the bank said. The fresh investigation by the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York and from the US Securities and Exchange Commission comes after UBS paid $780m (\u00a3512m) in 2009 to settle a separate Justice Department tax-evasion probe. And it comes as authorities in a range of countries are considering examining HSBC's actions. This renewed scrutiny underscores the persistent global effort to combat tax evasion and illicit financial flows, particularly in the wake of recent high-profile leaks revealing extensive undeclared assets. The use of bearer bonds has long been a concern for financial regulators due to their inherent anonymity. This latest development signals an intensified crackdown on practices that enable wealthy individuals to bypass tax obligations, putting further pressure on financial institutions worldwide to enhance transparency and compliance measures.",
        "The firm is accused of giving large donations to non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a close confidante of Ms Park. The donations were allegedly given in exchange for political support of a controversial merger. Ms Choi has been charged with coercion and attempted fraud. According to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, Choi Gee-sung, a Samsung vice chairman, and Chang Choong-ki, a president at the group, were being interviewed on Monday by special prosecutors about the corruption allegations. It was reported the pair were being treated as witnesses, rather than being suspected of any wrongdoing at this stage. The ongoing probe centers on allegations that the donations, reportedly totalling millions of dollars, were intended to secure government backing for the contentious 2015 merger of Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries. This deal was crucial for the succession plan of Samsung's de facto leader, Lee Jae-yong. The scandal, which has already led to the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye, continues to ensnare major South Korean conglomerates, highlighting deep-seated ties between business and politics.",

        "An official has told an assembly committee that Cardiff Aviation, which has leased a hangar at St Athan from the administration since 2012, has not paid rent for it to date. The Welsh Government is seeking legal advice over recovering the outstanding debt, a letter says. The company says talks are ongoing. It is not known how much the rent is worth. Mr Dickinson previously told BBC Wales that his firm was losing millions of pounds because of a dispute over landing rights. The Iron Maiden front-man set up Cardiff Aviation in 2012 at RAF St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan, leasing a large facility for its aircraft maintenance and pilot training operations. This significant debt, spanning over a decade, has prompted the Welsh Government to seek legal advice for recovery. While the precise rent value is undisclosed, the company's previous financial difficulties, including millions lost due to a dispute over landing rights, are understood to be relevant to the ongoing talks.",
        "The number given for the current account customers hit by the fraud is fewer than half of the 20,000 initially reported to have been affected. Personal data \"was not compromised\" in the attack, and all accounts affected had been refunded, the bank confirmed. Tesco Bank announced it was targeted by \"a systematic, sophisticated attack\" over the weekend, leading to unauthorized transactions on some customer accounts. Chief Executive Benny Higgins provided an update, stating, \"We've now refunded all customer accounts affected by fraud and lifted the suspension of online debit transactions so that customers can use their accounts as normal.\" He added that the bank acted quickly to mitigate the impact. During the initial phase of the incident, current account customers had been blocked from making online payments to prevent further losses and secure funds. This swift resolution aims to fully restore customer confidence after the unprecedented security breach.",
        "The woman repeatedly reported Craig Hutsby, of Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, for threatening behaviour and breach of bail conditions in July 2014. The following month Hutsby raped her. The IPCC report revealed the attack could have been prevented had arrest forms been filled out immediately. Det Supt Rachel Walker said officers had attended misconduct meetings. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) concluded that PC Sofi Essex has a case to answer for misconduct for not creating an \"arrest package\" - paperwork completed before arrest attempts can begin - when asked. \"Although eventually completed, the delay**s meant crucial opportunities to apprehend Hutsby were missed, enabling the rape,\" the IPCC stated. Systemic failings were highlighted; key steps not taken despite repeated warnings. PC Essex's inaction was a significant factor. Det Supt Walker confirmed new procedures and enhanced training are implemented to prevent future errors, stressing commitment to victim safety and accountability.**",
        "Thomas, 28, is a key member of the Team Sky side trying to guide Chris Froome to a second successive Tour title. Froome has already been sent for an X-ray after a crash during the fourth stage of the Tour de France. \"On the cobbles it's sketchy anyway. If it does rain it could end somebody's race quite easily,\" said Thomas. \"You train all year for this and for it to end like that would be devastating for whoever it was. \"So hopefully it stays dry and everyone stays out of trouble.\" Froome touched wheels in the peloton, causing a brief fall. The X-ray confirmed no fractures, a massive relief. Thomas's worries highlight the Tour's extreme early stage risks, especially with rain expected on the cobbled sections.

        "Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a fixed landline and the chance to book seven days in advance. Uber said: \"If adopted these [rules] would mean an end to the Uber people know and love.\" Black cab drivers have argued regulations need to be tightened. There has been growing pressure on city legislators, most recently when cab drivers protested outside City Hall. The Uber app connects customers and nearby drivers using GPS technology and gives an estimate of the fare. It generally charges lower fares, sparking fierce competition with traditional services.\n\nThe proposed regulations aim to address concerns over driver standards and public safety, issues frequently raised by traditional black cab drivers who undergo rigorous licensing. Uber's business model, relying on a large pool of private hire drivers, would be significantly impacted. This could lead to higher fares and reduced availability for its millions of users. The ongoing consultation period will allow all stakeholders to voice their opinions on these contentious proposals, which could redefine London's private hire landscape.",
        "The Saddlers looked more likely to take the lead in the first half, with Albion goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin keeping out Paul Downing and Romaine Sawyers. Burton came close when Stuart Beavon tricked his way into Walsall's box but fired into the side-netting. Wigan's win over Bury means Albion's lead at the top is cut to two points, with Walsall staying in fourth. Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough told BBC Radio Derby: Media playback is not supported on this device \"There was nothing in it at all. It was never going to be a classic. Both teams battled hard, and a draw felt like a fair result in the end, given the chances created. It\u2019s a point gained against a good Walsall side, and we move on to the next challenge.\"\n\nThe goalless draw at the Pirelli Stadium means Burton maintain their strong home record, while Walsall secured a valuable away point in their push for promotion.

Both sides will now turn their attention to crucial upcoming fixtures as the League One promotion race intensifies.",
        "A website polled users as to which country he should tour next, with no restrictions on the nations that could be voted on. There are now almost half a million votes to send the singer to the secretive communist nation. The contest, which ends at 0600 on 7 July, saw North Korea move from 24th to 1st place in less than two days. Many of the votes are thought to originate from imageboard website 4chan, which has built a reputation for triggering online viral campaigns. The voting site is not endorsed by Mr Bieber's record label. Given the fact that almost all citizens of North Korea have no internet access and are subject to strict state control, the prospect of an international pop star performing there is highly improbable, if not impossible.\n\nThe sudden surge in votes for the isolated nation is widely attributed to users of 4chan, notorious for orchestrating online hoaxes and \"trolling\" campaigns. This latest prank highlights the platform's ability to manipulate online polls and generate significant, albeit bizarre, media attention. While the poll gains traction, it remains a far-fetched scenario for the Canadian pop sensation, Bieber, to visit Pyongyang. The outcome, however, guarantees a memorable conclusion to this unusual online phenomenon.",

Public participation is crucial in deciding which of these majestic natural landmarks will represent the nation on the European stage.",
        "Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are taking part in a pilot scheme following the study. Coercive or controlling behaviour became a criminal offence last year. The research found that although most domestic abuse incidents were handled in a \"professional\" way, some officers still displayed \"negative and uninformed\" attitudes. In particular, police tended to neglect cases where suspects did not use violence but tried to control their victim in other ways such as by making threats. The report said: This oversight puts vulnerable individuals at continued risk, as non-physical control can be just as devastating and often escalates. The pilot scheme aims to address these critical gaps, improving officer understanding and response to the full spectrum of domestic abuse, ensuring victims receive appropriate protection regardless of the nature of the abuse. This initiative highlights the ongoing need for police training to reflect the evolving legal landscape and understanding of complex domestic abuse patterns, ultimately safeguarding more victims.",
        "The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house and is expected to be endorsed by the upper chamber. Under its constitution, Japan is barred from using force to resolve conflicts except in cases of self-defence. But a reinterpretation of the law will now allow \"collective self-defence\" - using force to defend allies under attack. Police are lining the streets and telling protesters to move along in an attempt to minimise disruption in the capital's centre. Despite the wet weather, thousands of protesters remain outside the parliament, chanting against the legislation. They argue this historic reinterpretation of Article 9, Japan's pacifist constitution, risks dragging the nation into foreign conflicts. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government asserts the changes are vital for national security amidst regional threats from China and North Korea. This controversial move, a profound shift in Japan's post-war defence policy, continues to spark intense public debate.",

        "The site is believed to contain thousands of copies of a video game called ET The Extra-Terrestrial. A company called Atari made the game in 1982 but it was a flop and is famously thought of as one of the worst video games ever made. It's thought Atari could have dumped millions of unsold copies in a landfill site in September 1983. This legendary tale of gaming failure, often cited as a contributing factor to the 1983 video game crash, is being highlighted by Gordon Sinclair from the retro gaming event Play Blackpool.\n\nSinclair points out that while ET holds a special place in infamy, other titles have also vied for the \"worst game ever\" crown. Among these contenders are Cassette 50, Z50 Spectrum published by Cascade Games Ltd, the Amiga title Rise of the Robots by Time Warner Interactive, and the much-maligned Superman for Nintendo 64. These games, like ET, serve as cautionary tales in video game development history, reminding us that even with good intentions, not every game can be a classic.",

        "The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling, was visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with 74 pensioner flats. Opponents insist the unlisted building is historically significant and an influx of elderly residents would put pressure on services in the village. The plans to be considered by the National Park Authority (NPA) are open for consultation until early January. Originally named, Glasshayes House, the mansion house on the edge of Lyndhurst was built in the early 19th Century as a private home for railway entrepreneur Charles Castleman.
