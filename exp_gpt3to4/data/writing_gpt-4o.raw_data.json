        "You tell Death that you will never tire of living no matter how long you live. It makes you a bet that you will and thus grants you true immortality. You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle! Ha!\" Death snorted. \"Yes, the circle. I've seen it I don't know how many times now.\" \"It's been about thirty.\" \"Okay, so I've seen it thirty times, and each time manages to be just as beautiful as the last.\" \"How? You've lost everyone you've ever loved, seen the world blown to pieces again and again. How can you still be in love with that damn circle? You know I told you that as a joke.\" \"It doesn't matter. Not to me. I love the circle of life. Because no matter how many times I think I've seen it all. The universe shows me just how beautiful it can be all over again. Every time you and I see the circle, it happens all over again, the explosion, the formation and destruction of the stars, the stars forming planets, and then eventually humans.",

Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer. They were crying for their mother, hungry and alone.",

She doesn't struggle. They always struggle. \"Stay quiet,\" I tell her. Although, I don't need to. She hasn't uttered a single word. No screams, no fighting, absolutely nothing. It's almost boring. I toss her over my shoulder and make my way through the house. I watch where I place my feet. A pink bone nearly detonates but I move my foot at the last second. I see the family dog lying on her bed. Or, rather, what's left of it. It's hard to make out this late, but all I can see is shredded blanket. The dog cowers in the back. I walk towards her, careful not to tip the girl on my shoulders. She begins to sink lower into the ground. As I reach my hand out towards her, I hear a small whine.

Should we all just forget about this and go home? Maybe...... Should we heed the AI's warning? We all looked at each other, each person in the lab more afraid then the next to say a word.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you. It is matrilineal, meaning it is passed on through the females of the line. Soon, you will be able to see things no other person will see. You will* know *when some things will come to pass.

The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again. As I neared the docks, my eyes were drawn to a nearby newsstand. A graphic image of a red skinned warrior being gunned down by legionnaires",

The war lords in Africa, coordinating mass rapes and other war crimes. The Eights and Nines are the ones responsible for atrocities against humanity.

Hastily, he scanned the field for whatever they were cheering for. Then, he spotted it: Jason Rodriguez from the New Mexico ET's had forgotten to touch the secret base. Saul Vasquez, the Tigers' best pitcher, lobbed the ball at Rodriguez hard. Rodriguez collapsed and tumbled to the ground, where he stayed until the medics arrived with a stretcher.

At the least maybe they could've paired me off with one of the other guards. Instead, they sent me, a narcoleptic armed guard, to stand watch for any impending attacks. Not the brightest of ideas, but then again, a lack of intelligence was the reason for my kingdom finding itself in this position in the first place. Fully aware once again, I heard the guard bellow from the tower for a second time. \"All is lost!\" he screamed. \"The enemy is through the gate!\" Perhaps the enemy forces marched right past me, assuming I was dead. After all, not many people possess the ability to sleep through an attack. But they're not me, Sir Serons of the Kingdom of Peels. All around me enemy forces were charging forth to the soundtrack of clanking armors, barreling hooves and cheers of valor.

Sam Jackson took hold of Quentin's hand and gave it a good shake and looked the director in the eye and replied, \"Yeah, hey, that was a funny joke, when do I get the real script?\" Quentin tilted his head slightly and said, \"No, that is the script.\" Sam blinked his eyes slowly and sat looking at Quentin for a moment before his face broke out into a huge grin, \"Get the BLEEP out of here, you are BLEEP with me right now.\" Quentin sighed and took a sip from his wine glass and then said, \"Sam, we have worked with each other quite a bit over the years, you always seem to pull",

        "Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze at, except at significant distance",

Jared could hear the man's chair turn around as he spoke. \"Why did I hire you as an assistant if- good God, don't play with that!\" A gloved hand snatched the doom ball from mid-air before Jared made another catch. The sound of the chair turning back around came from behind Jared as the boy grabbed two of the smaller devices and put them under his shirt.

In the very center lies the Disc, the harsh light glaring off of its shiny surface. I watch my colleagues once again scan the Disc, once again finding nothing. Our greatest academics had decided that mathematics would be the only way to efficiently communicate with other alien civilizations, seeing that our complex language was far too hard for others to understand without assistance. The first few scans cleared up the physical properties of the item - hundreds of rings, with even more grooves in each ring. At first we thought that we were supposed to run an item, a sort of *bit*, through the rings, but when we discovered the full physical appearence it seemed nonsensical. I left the Disc tests to another scientist under my command and moved on to the second test chamber, where the actual space vehicle was being tested. It was an interesting design, with a dish antennae. It had been disassembled and categorized before a copy was made for physical examination.

He could remember the way it looked, the way it felt, even the way it smelled, but the mind has a way of playing tricks on a young child's mind. Perhaps it was just a fabrication of his impressionable young mind. Maybe his frustration at his piano practices caused him to conjure up a magic piano on his walks through the forest behind his house. It wasn't just that he could play any song that he wanted, it was that the music in his head could finally come out. Everything that his soul wanted to express could finally come out. Every tone, sound, rhythm and dynamic he couldn't express during his practice with his teacher could finally be heard. All the despair and secret problems he kept away from the world could be shared with that piano. It became his best friend. That piano was there, in a hidden grotto in the woods, every time he went back. The little boy stopped visiting the piano as frequently the better he got. Soon he was spending more time on his piano at home than the magical one the woods. But, whenever he got stuck or simply couldn't hear what his brain was trying to say, he could always talk to his old friend. One day, after he had just finished his senior recital that he spent the past five months practicing, he took a walk alone in the woods. But there was no piano to be found that night, or any night",

But it seemed hotter than it should be - could the scans be erroneous? Planet 3 was worth a look too - too cold for liquid gallium, but maybe it had localized hot areas that could sustain this basic building block of life, especially if reports of its reasonably low axial tilt and large moon were accurate.

Via releasing trillions of nanomachines in the air and making a program that could control them, I could stab anyone, anywhere. All I'd have to do is type in a target, and the global nanomachine network would find them and let me take them down. The machines were everywhere, in everything, in everyone. I could find anyone, and have the machines stab them in the face. Of course, the first thing I did was program an exception for myself and people I didn't want stabbed, especially in the face. I knew exactly how to monetize it, too. Within a few years, I was the richest person in the world, which also meant, although not officially, ruler of the world. There was two main tricks to doing so. The program only cost a few hundred dollars. Well within the price range of most people. It was untraceable, so that it would be unable to be discovered who stabbed who. The first couple years, I sold it on the Deep Web. Of course, there was also the second item: becoming an exception. For the equivalent of $ 100,000, you'd be added to the \"Do Not Stab\" list. I made so much, I was able to buy enough politicians to make everything about it legal. Sales of both leaped overnight.

Six brothers and one bastard descended upon Ashum and bore life upon it. Mahakam and his elven people were the first to populate the lands, with swords made of meteorite and cities made of glass.

In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow.

It's 80's night, and you vowed you would never come on an 80's night.\" The lights were streaming through the club as old favorites blasted through the speakers. People out on the dance floor, having the time of their lives, enjoying the moment. Tony stared at his empty glass. \"Have you ever had a thought in the back of your head that just gnaws at you all day? I mean, what am I doing with my life? I've worked all my life, for that moment in time, and yet it can come or pass you by...\" The bartender just stared at Tony. \"We all have to work Tony. Look at me, I'm working here in this club serving drinks to sad fellas like you.\" As tony was contemplating the words, a song started to come on.

It seemed to soak in every drop and hold it, the weight of his mounting worries manifesting themself all too literally in his drenched garb. He had been walking for hours in this wood with no sign of civillzation; he gritted his teeth against the idea of setting up his tent in this downpour. Then, as though the forces that control the universe had decided he had finally had enough, a side path that branched off to somewhere sprang up, and a quick inspection showed that somewhere to be an enormous victorian mansion, almost indiscernable through the rain and against the twilight sky. The traveler dashed toward it, the otherwise ominous gargoyles looking more like butlers with warm towels. He reached the door and, despite his conditions, had to take a moment to revel in the house's magnitude. The front door alone dwarfed him, and one of the heavy brass knockers looked like it cost more than he had made in his lifetime.

A massive fireball erupted just a couple of miles away. Moments later I felt it. The smashing, thudding, sensation of a shock wave, followed instantly by a loud boom. I stumbled backwards as the pressure ripped through my body, taking me by surprise. This definitely wasn't a movie, the sound and flash perfectly in sync. This was real. I sat down on a large rock.'Well.... shit,' I mumbled. The fireball was gone now, but the fire blazed strong, fighting the natural elements that were it's enemy. It licked skyward.

The flames were spreading to other buildings now, and secondary explosions, though smaller than the first, were starting to echo across the hills.

I furrowed my eyebrows and looked at my black TV screen. Weird. I've heard about this happening before but it was new to me. Not hearing the warnings I woke up to listen to was\u2026 different.

I looked at my heel and there it was, a little triangular birthmark precisely located on my heel. 50 years ago, scientists discovered that reincarnation was a real thing and that birthmarks were an indicator of how we died in that previous life. Most people didn't have such birthmarks but those who had one could eventually ask for PIs to investigate about who they were in a previous life. By knowing who you were in a previous life, it could lead to potential inheritance if you died without husband/wife and kids, but that was really exceptional and most people did it just to know about previous lives.",

She tried to reminisce of her time on this world, but her life stretched beyond time immemorial like a river without a source.

On one hand, she was rather hurt that everything that helped make her *her* could fit into such little space. On the other, she was sad that after today she would be alone again, thrown into the lion's den as naked as she came.

        "A little girl helps her neighbor overcome his vow of silence he made after his wife passed away 40 years ago. I've lived next door to Mr Wynn for the past seven years. He always seemed very gentle, very considerate. He never asked for anything, and was happy to listen whenever I spoke to him. A friend of his told me about the vow of silence he took, and about his dedication to the wife he lost so tragically all those years ago. The reason I am standing here today, despite the fact that I am not exactly a close friend or family member, is to say thank you, and pay tribute to a wonderful man. My daughter, Sam, would often talk to him. She would ask him why he doesn't talk, and he would just smile back at her. The attention span of a six year old being what it is, she generally moved on pretty quickly. He would let her pick flowers from his garden to bring home to us. His sprinklers were timed for when the kids arrived home from school on sunny days. He always had sweets ready on Halloween, and would feign terror when she arrived in her costume. Mr Wynn died saving my daughters life. She ran out onto the road, and he saw from the front garden. I didn't see what happened, I just heard Sam crying. I ran to her. She was crying for Mr Wynn. He had pushed her out of the way. He saved",

I park my car beside the bridge over the Arkansas river, the water is down and it's the perfect temperature for swimming. I make my way down the beaten path made by all the people who use this spot for the perfect fishing hole. I jump in, the water is a bit chillier than the public pool would be. I watch as a barge rolls past, slowly churning up the river. Something taps my foot, it feels strange so I grab it and pull it up. A beautiful glass bottle, etched with the first coke logo with a cork in the top surfaces. There's a note and some rocks in the bottom. What could it be? I drag myself to the bank of the river, and walk back up to my truck. I reach in and get my swiss army knife out of the glove box and pull out the cork.

        "The running faucet The faucet had a third knob. She tried the knob on the left, and hot water came out of the faucet. Just as she expected, the one on the right was cold. But the third nob.... Grace didn't know what that might be. She closed both taps and the faucet stopped running. She would try the third one next. Like everything in Giovanni's workshop, it would probably be something wonderful and unexpected. Birds flew out of drawers when she opened them. The birds were red and green and gold and didn't look like any birds Grace had ever seen, not even when Giovanni had taken her to the aviary at the zoo. The kitchen had these strange machines with gears and pipes that played beautiful music when he tinkered in there. The mirrors were very nice and gave her the most lovely complements when she tried on big-girl clothes. So the mystery of the third faucet tap would also be a great surprise when she tried it. Giovanni's hand barely caught Grace's in time. \"No, my flower!\" He was frightened. She could tell. \"You know what I have told you about touching things in my workshop!\" Giovanni caught his breath, but he never dropped his gaze. \"I'm sorry, uncle,\" she mewed pathetically. \"I have told you, I have taught you time and again. If you are to learn what I have to teach you, to take my place, then you must be patient. I have promised to introduce you to every marvel I have created in time."

For the first time in decades, there was a bumper crop and nobody would go hungry in the winter. Taxes were much lower now, thanks to the new king. Oh, his enemies called him evil, mostly because he cared more about efficiency than honor. But he knew how to run a kingdom properly. He had actually freed many of the serfs as well. The army was larger than before, which put a stop to the constant raids from neighboring territories that had long plagued the borders.\n\nVillagers, once fearful of famine and pestilence, now found themselves bustling in thriving markets with goods from distant lands.

Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the gases, pockets of dense, life-supporting atmospheres form around celestial bodies, creating habitable zones rich in diverse ecosystems. Islands of floating land, buoyed by the denser gases, drift lazily across the sky, teeming with lush vegetation and strange creatures adapted to their unique aerial environment.

The narrative style echoes the vast silence of a landscape devoid of words, highlighting the tumult within her mind.\n\nThis approach mirrors the vast wasteland of the brain, where thoughts roam in solitude, crafting a tale of resilience and quiet strength.

        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will inevitably follow. Embrace the chaos of your first drafts, for they are the playground where your ideas can run wild without the constraints of perfection. It's important to let your thoughts flow freely, unedited and unrestrained, because hidden gems often appear in the most unexpected places.\n\nSet aside your inner critic and focus on the act of creation. Write with abandon, knowing that revision is where the magic of crafting and honing your message will truly happen. Remember, every celebrated writer began with pages of rough, unpolished words before they discovered their voice and honed their craft.\n\nSo, start today. Write without fear, without judgment. Allow your imagination to roam, and trust that with practice and persistence, your unique voice will emerge. In time, the stories you shape will echo with the authenticity and brilliance that comes from having begun at the beginning and journeyed to the end.",

Contact is about to be made between two very different continents with very different societies. The warning signal blared over the canteen. \"Contact estimate 240 seconds. Collect your gear and get to the Contact Point. Command out.\" \"Oh, Crap.\" Jace thought. It is a rare event for two island states to come together. The bureaucracy was tough, let alone if it was on a collision course. Sadly, this time, it was no different. Jace grabbed his equipment and scrambled toward the Contact Point, a designated area where representatives from each continent would meet to initiate communication and negotiation. His heart raced, not just from the urgency of the situation, but from the excitement of encountering a society that had evolved independently over centuries.\n\nAs Jace reached the gathering spot, he joined a diverse group of scientists, linguists, and diplomats, all buzzing with anticipation. The floating continent approaching them was known for its advanced technology, while Jace's home was celebrated for its rich cultural heritage and environmental stewardship.\n\nThe air hummed with potential and uncertainty. Would they find common ground, or would their differences lead to conflict? Either way, this unprecedented meeting promised to reshape the future of both continents.

Ultimately, I hope to find a piece where the passion of the writer seeps through, making me eager to dive into their universe and explore every corner of their",
        "Life and Death decide to switch places for a time to see which of their jobs is harder. Death looked across the stars, at the glowing figure of Life. \"So, How was it?\" He asks gliding his hand toward it. \"Awful, How do you live with yourself?\" Life asked, going back to her rightful place \"Where you able to do it to anyone?\" \"Jeffry Adams. I'll never forget his name, he looked at me dead in the eyes, and pleaded to go back to his family\" \"But it was his time\" \"Through all the ages, I've never realized the weight you carry,\" Life admitted, a shadow of empathy clouding her radiant presence. \"Every soul has a story, a network of connections that I simply nurture, but you... you sever them.\"\n\nDeath nodded, absorbing Life's newfound understanding. \"And you, how did you manage my realm?\"\n\n\"It was chaos,\" Life confessed, her voice tinged with fatigue. \"Constantly balancing the scales, ensuring growth doesn't spiral into uncontrollable entropy. The delicate dance of creation is exhausting.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Death replied, his hollow eyes softening. \"We're two sides of the same coin, yet our burdens are profoundly different.\"\n\nLife and Death returned to their duties, each carrying a deeper appreciation for the other's path. Though their roles remained irrevocably separate, they found solace in the knowledge that neither path was easy, and both were necessary for the universe's delicate balance.",
        "the monster in the closet finally lures the child into the darkness, only to realize something is very very wrong The beast peered through the small crack in the ajar door, as it did every night. It saw the child stir and roll over, facing the creature now. As was he usual by now, it extended a thin, furry arm, asking in its eerily high pitched voice \"Wan na Play?\". Unlike all of those other times, instead of pulling the covers over her head and crying for a guardian, the small girl sat up and stared at the closet door.

        "You are a compulsive liar. Convince me you are not. In order to be a good liar\u2014the best liar\u2014you have to have a complete understanding of the truth. You have to know what you're hiding from, what you're running from. Within every lie, there is some dark spot, some blurred edge. The truth is always there; you just have to find it. So maybe I'm lying. Or maybe I'm telling the truth, because I know you won't believe me. Maybe it's both\u2014just enough truth to convince you, just enough lie to intrigue you.\n\nThe mind of a liar is a complex labyrinth where truth and deception dance in a delicate, intricate balance. Understanding this means acknowledging that deception is not always built on falsehoods but on an artful blend of reality and fiction. In this interplay, the lie becomes a narrative, reflecting fears, desires, and unspoken truths. So, question what you hear, but also question the truth you think you know. Sometimes, the",
        "Your ascent into sanity The thrill of defeating the pure incarnation of evil vibrated through every inch of my body. This thing was finally dead after four years of constant torture. It has followed me from room to room, day after day. It followed me every time I went out, every time I ate dinner, every time I went to the bathroom. This demon that had sunk its teeth deep into my chest and sucked out my lifeforce leaving only this hollow shell of the person that was. Always there, screaming, demanding to be heard, taking away everything I had ever loved. It robbed me of my joy, my peace, and my sanity. But now, as I stood over its defeated form, I felt the chains binding me to it shatter, each link falling away into nothingness. My mind, once a stormy ocean of chaos, began to calm. With each breath, I inhaled freedom, exhaled the remnants of fear.\n\nThe room around me, once distorted by the shadows of my torment, gradually filled with light. I blinked, adjusting to this new clarity, the world slowly coming into focus. The colors seemed brighter, the air crisper\u2014a world reborn. It was as though I had been given new eyes to see the beauty I had long forgotten.\n\nIn that moment of victory, I realized this triumph was not just over the demon, but a reclaiming of myself. I was whole again, ready to embrace the life I thought lost. The journey was over, and my true healing had just begun.",
        "Within a year of birth, every parent receives a small gift or note from their 18-year-old child via time travel. You don't. Seventeen years, and 364 days had passed since David's birth. I grew extremely anxious and stressed more than I ever could. What could be more stressful than never receiving your child's 18th year letter? David sat across the room. He was reading a Calvin and Hobbes comic. His father had left the day he was born, and I never knew why. But that never bothered David. The boy still adored going through his father's wares.\n\nOn the eve of his 18th birthday, as if sensing my turmoil, David looked up from his comic. \"Mom, you okay?\" he asked, his eyes reflecting a wisdom beyond his years. Suddenly, the air shimmered, and a small envelope appeared on the table. David smiled knowingly. \"I guess I wanted to surprise you,\" he said. Relief washed over me as I realized",
        "A voice in the sky will tell you when you've left a place for the last time. You tell your SO goodbye and head out to the office. Halfway there you hear, \"You have visited a location for the last time.\" John wrinkled his nose and cleared his throat. Pausing, he put down his briefcase and adjusted his tie. It was a red tie with white stripes. This was one of his favorite ties. He picked up his briefcase and walked to his car. It was the last car in the lot, as was common on every night.\n\nAs he drove, John's mind drifted to the mundane comforts of his routine, the coffee shop on the corner, the creaky elevator ride up to his office. But now, he couldn't shake the finality of the voice's message. Was it the office he was leaving behind, or something much larger? The glow of the streetlights seemed dimmer, and for the first time, the night felt like a",

No-one but me may cross the threshold into the area that I have created that is for no-one else but me. There is a small, worn wooden desk against the wall, cluttered with notebooks filled with half-formed ideas and pens that have been chewed to exhaustion.

        "Living in the worst possible timeline / If there is a parallel universe for every possible outcome, there must be one with the worst possible outcomes. Mortimer's eyes were barely open morning slits of light when the shot rang out. As he focused on the pajama'd elephant slumped before him his only thought was \"How did he get in those?\". He rolled himself over the beast, up and out of bed, with his right foot landing squarely on top of a banana peel. The peel assisted Mortimer in constructing a dance of improbable complexity as he and the peel slid back and forth across the polished wooden floor. Mortimer, arms flailing like a windmill in a hurricane, desperately reached for anything to stabilize himself. Unfortunately, his hand found the cord of a table lamp, sending it crashing to the floor with a sound like a dozen broken dreams. \n\nAs he finally regained his balance, Mortimer looked around, surveying the chaos that had unfolded in mere seconds. The elephant, now snoring gently, lay in a heap as if mocking his morning misadventure. Mortimer sighed, rubbing his temples, and muttered to himself, \"There must be a universe where mornings start with coffee, not calamity.\"\n\nIn this timeline, he was merely a man trying to navigate a world where the absurdity seemed to hold dominion. No matter how hard he tried, each day began with its own brand of chaos, leaving him to wonder if somewhere, some version of himself was waking up to tranquillity.",
        "The day Death died. A young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was a little tired, it was her heavy breathing that gave it away. She was ready for the next step, but she did not know what the next step was. She tried to reminisce of her time on this world, but her life stretched beyond time immemorial like a river without a source. The memories that dripped upon her were recent ones of people she recently met. An old man laid still in hospice care with his frail hand resting gently on hers, whispering stories of his youth as he drifted between worlds. A mother clutched her newborn tightly, her eyes filled with the paradox of joy and fear. Each soul had left an indelible mark on the girl, etching new lines on her ageless essence.\n\nThe day Death died, a peculiar calmness enveloped the world. The young girl, who had long served as the silent companion to those crossing the threshold, found herself untethered. Her ancient heart, unburdened by the weight of destiny, beat with an unfamiliar rhythm of possibility. People around the world, oblivious to the monumental shift, continued their lives, weaving stories anew, unchained from the shadows of mortality.\n\nThe girl rose from the bench, invigorated by newfound freedom. She wandered into the vibrant tapestry of the park, ready to embrace a role yet undefined, in a world where life was no longer a fleeting whisper.",
        "Don't leave me, you're my best friend. A little girl sat alone on her bed with her legs tucked tightly to her chest, her arms wrapped around her shins locking them firmly in place as she shook quietly. Jenny's room was nearly empty, all that remained were some old chests, dressers and the bare bed on which she curled. In a large cardboard box, the kind that sagged along the bottom with crinkled corners, thick tape all around and sharpie on the sides were all her earthly possessions. Glaring at the box through moist eyes, she felt a profound sense of loss that weighed heavier than the air in the near-empty room. Each item in that box held a memory, a whisper of laughter shared and secrets spilled. Her favorite teddy bear, its fur now worn and patchy, lay on top, staring back with button eyes that seemed to promise comfort. But Jenny knew that comfort was fleeting.\n\nHer family was moving to a new town, a new beginning, they said. Yet to Jenny, it felt like an end. The chipped paint on the walls surrounding her was all she had ever known. The thought of leaving her best friend, Lily, behind was unbearable. They had shared dreams of adventures and pinky promises of forever.\n\nWith a shaky breath, Jenny brushed her tears away, trying to be brave. She whispered a hopeful promise to herself: that she would find a way to hold onto the memories and maybe, just maybe, she would find new best friends.",
        "Explain a piece of modern technology to a person from around 100-500 CE. \"Look, are you even trying to understand? It's really not that complicated.\" The Roman senator turns his head and looks at me, confusion painted on his face. In his hands he holds a TV remote. For his ease of access I had painted Roman numerals on the buttons, though he doesn't quite seem to grasp the concept. \"Look, push the red button. It's the only goddamn red button on the remote.\" He tilts his head, and I sigh. \"The. power of this device lies in its ability to summon moving images and sounds from afar,\" I explain, trying to simplify the concept. \"Imagine a scroll that tells a story, but instead of reading, you watch and listen as it unfolds before your eyes.\"\n\nThe senator's brows knit together, skepticism not entirely banished. \"And these images come from where?\"\n\n\"From far-off places, transmitted through invisible signals,\" I say, gesturing vaguely to the sky. \"They are captured by this 'television,' a box that translates the signals into what you see and hear.\"\n\nHe nods slowly, still mystified. \"And this... remote?\" he asks, holding it up as if it's an artifact from another world.\n\n\"It lets you choose what story you want to see. The Roman numerals are like pages of a book; each button leads to a different tale.\"\n\nHis eyes widen, a flicker of understanding dawning. \u201cA wondrous thing,\u201d he murmurs, marveling",
        "A little girl helps her neighbor overcome his vow of silence he made after his wife passed away 40 years ago. I've lived next door to Mr Wynn for the past seven years. He always seemed very gentle, very considerate. He never asked for anything, and was happy to listen whenever I spoke to him. A friend of his told me about the vow of silence he took, and about his dedication to the wife he lost so tragically all those years ago. The reason I am standing here today, despite the fact that I am not exactly a close friend or family member, is because of my daughter, Lily. At just eight years old, Lily possesses a unique curiosity and warmth that draws people in. She would often sit on our porch, coloring, and occasionally wave at Mr. Wynn when he tended to his garden. He'd nod back, a faint smile on his lips.\n\nOne day, Lily decided to hand him a drawing she'd made of a sunflower, knowing how much Mr. Wynn loved his garden. To my surprise, he accepted it with trembling hands, and for the first time, spoke a few words: \"Thank you, it's beautiful.\"\n\nThat small interaction sparked a change. Slowly, through Lily's art and her innocent questions about flowers and life, Mr. Wynn began to share stories of his past, breaking the silence of four decades. Today, we gather as friends, not just neighbors, to celebrate the voice he found again, thanks to the simple kindness of a little girl.",
        "A 101-year old bottle washed up on a beach with a letter inside. It's for you. I park my car beside the bridge over the Arkansas river, the water is down and it's the perfect temperature for swimming. I make my way down the beaten path made by all the people who use this spot for the perfect fishing hole. I jump in, the water is a bit chillier than the public pool would be. I watch as a barge rolls past, slowly churning up the river. Something taps my foot, it feels strange so I grab it and pull it to the surface. To my astonishment, it's a barnacle-encrusted bottle, seemingly ancient. Curiosity piqued, I wade back to the shore, the bottle cradled carefully in my hands. The glass is amber and thick, with an ornate, faded label hinting at distant origins. I find a rock to pry the corroded cork, releasing a musty scent mingled with the crisp river breeze.\n\nInside, a parchment with inked handwriting unfurls, surprisingly preserved. The message, penned in elegant script, speaks of long-lost love and a promise to find a way back, even if it takes eternity. It's addressed not to a name but to \"the dreamer who dares to believe.\"\n\nI sit by the water, the sun casting golden glimmers across the waves, contemplating the serendipity of this discovery. Somehow, across a century, it's as if the universe has whispered a timeless message just for me.",
