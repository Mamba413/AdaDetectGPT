        "We had dinner here last night. It was our second time eating at Moishes, and the place had been remodeled since the last time we were there about a decade ago. It looks like the inside of a casino. Wall-to-wall carpet, glass chandeliers, wood paneling. The tables are packed in, and the place was full to the gills on Friday night. It was fairly raucous. The ambiance is not unpleasant; it's just very lively. Perfect for people watching. \\n\\nThey seat you and bring bread, good coleslaw and pickles right away, which is nice. We ordered the shrimp cocktail, a ribeye and a porterhouse, fries, a Montecarlo potato and mushrooms. The sides were tasty. The steaks were not. Good quality meat, but it was bland, under spiced, grey on the outside instead of charbroiled. Weirdly enough, Moishes actually sells a brand of steak spice, but",
        "Hmmmm - not sure how this place has won awards or was so busy the night we went. \\n\\nWe were greeted promptly and seated right away, always a plus. We were greeted by two different waiters - not a big deal as they were busy. BUT when our waiter came up to the table (and it's really loud so it was hard to hear him) we weren't ready to order drinks yet, and after greeting us he just walked away. Again, it was loud so I'm not sure if he said anything but it didn't look like it.\\n\\nWhen he came back, we ordered drinks and asked about appetizers. He recommended the lollipops and was forthcoming with offering suggestions, which again was good.\\n\\nThe lollipops were minced up chicken meat rolled up and fried - extremely strange. They menu made it sound like they were more like skewers or chicken wings, not",

So I worked to fit this time into my schedule and bargained with coworkers to get out of work early. 5:45 comes and nobody shows...So I call Cox. It is now 6:45 and I am still waiting for somebody to take me off hold. Meanwhile I am \\\"\"live-chatting\\\"\" with a rep named Maritza R. who cannot tell me if the tech will be arriving and tells me that if they aren't there in the window they wont come. I told her that her customer service is lousy and I would like a manager. She promptly ends the chat. So I start a new chat.",

The massage tables are heated and really comfortable. \\n\\nMy friend and I made reservations for 50 minute massages, but decided when we got there that we wanted an 80 minute one. The receptionist said that they couldn't accommodate us, which is understandable. But when we were done there was no one waiting to go next and it seemed like more than 2 masseuses were free.\\n\\nI chose the combination of deep tissue and Swedish massage. The masseuse said she would apply the deep tissue massage for the areas that needed it. I specifically mentioned that I had a huge knot in my lower back, yet the therapist spent less than 5 minutes on it initially, and only worked on it after I",

He ignored my request and wanted to continue with my goals. Told him I just wanted to do cardio and to lose weight.

I was not very happy with the whole process from start to finish. There are too many ridiculous rules. For one thing, I think it's good business to honor coupons that are presented, whether or not they are expired--the purpose is to attract business, right? Then we need to bring in our own cake, which is fine, but you can't say we NEED to bring one type of food item, and then BAN other food items. I brought some chips and crackers to the party room. Then I was told (after I already set everything up) that we couldn't have snacks in the party room. Or drinks. Would YOU like to attend a party with no snacks or drinks?

The shrimp is undercooked, lower grade and on 4 little ones for the extra $2. I guess it breaks down to 50 cent per shirmp that isn't even close to as good as it was. The Pad Thai Noodles are all clumped together and you can't use the cheap flimsy plastic fork to even get through it. The noodles are dark brown and full of what taste like GARLIC!

Royal Thai also had pretty lame curry, so I was excited to give Weera a try.\\n\\nI ordered the duck curry. It was listed on a sign outside as a \\\"\"special\\\"\" dish. It looked nice and red and yummy on the sign. When I got my duck curry, the look alone had me concerned. It was a light custardy color. The taste... bland as hell. I've never had such a bland curry before. Yeah, the waitress forgot to ask me what spice level I wanted, but this was just ridiculous. \\n\\nThe other ingredients weren't bad, although they added little cherry tomatoes to try and boost the flavorless curry. The duck was ok, and the veggies",

The rim was obviously a replica as the lip was slightly different, the color was slightly different, and the rim lacked the OEM BMW markings. Getting an OEM rim was very important as the OEM rims were forged and the replica was not. I told the bodyshop I would handle the mix up.

When we arrived at the cars in the parking garage, I was told we would be in a Fiat 500. While I am sure the Fiat would have been fun to drive, it was much too small for our needs.

I waited another 25 minutes to check in, only to be told by him that I was in the wrong line to begin with and its my fault (every other person in my line was there to check in as well). Not sure how we all were at fault. Maybe Juaquine, before screwing over 20 people in line out of 30 minutes of their time, start at the front of the line and politely ask what they are waiting on.

My only complaint was that our server did not make it clear whatsoever that the portions are family style. If you are ordering a side dish, it's definitely enough for two or three people.

Griffin was not having it! He ignored my request and wanted to continue with my goals. Told him I just wanted to do cardio and to lose weight. I asked to see the gym before we discussed prices so I have a better idea of what I was getting into.\n\nGriffin was extremely pushy and completely disregarded my request. Instead of showing me around, he kept hammering me about membership packages and trying to upsell me on personal training. His aggressive sales tactics made me extremely uncomfortable. When I finally insisted on seeing the gym, the equipment looked outdated an",
        "I had my son's birthday party at the waterpark in the hotel. They advertise this service, and even offer coupons from time to time. I was not very happy with the whole process from start to finish. There are too many ridiculous rules. For one thing, I think it's good business to honor coupons that are presented, whether or not they are expired--the purpose is to attract business, right? Then we need to bring in our own cake, which is fine, but you can't say we NEED to bring one type of food item, and then BAN other food items without a clear explanation.\n\nThe staff was unhelpful and seemed more interested in enforcing arbitrary rules than ensuring guest satisfaction. The party area was cramped, and the waterpark itself was overcrowded. Lifeguards appeared disinterested, and the facilities looked dated and poorly maintained. The prices were also significantly higher than expected, making the entire experience",
        "Here's the review:\n\nThis place is a classic \"don't be fooled by the outside\" place. Located across from CPCC in an unassuming strip mall with a tiny parking lot, this little gem is just waiting to make your date more interesting, your mouth do a little dance and your wallet skip a beat!\n\nI always go for lunch here because it's $5.99-$6.99 for the same size portions as dinner (dinner is around $10-$12). I always get the spicy chicken dish and await the fun. To those who might hesitate, trust me, this restaurant is a hidden treasure. The flavors are bold, the spices are perfectly balanced, and the portions are generous. The staff is friendly and quick, making the dining experience even more enjoyable. The spicy chicken is a standout - tender, well-seasoned, and packed with a kick that will wake up your taste buds",
        "Here's the review:\n\nIs it happening again? Seems the ownership is changed, I don't recognize the people that used to be here. The food is not the same and not in a good way, I just had the lunch special with the $2 upcharge for shrimp instead of chicken. The shrimp is undercooked, lower grade and on 4 little ones for the extra $2. I guess it breaks down to 50 cent per shrimp that isn't even close to as good as it was. The Pad Thai Noodles are all clumped together and you can't use the cheap flimsy plastic utensils without everything falling apart. What happened to the amazing Thai restaurant I used to love? The quality has dramatically dropped, portions have shrunk, and prices have increased. The vibrant flavors I remember are now bland and uninspired. I'm disappointed and won't be returning. This",

I was hopeful after calling them up and asking them if their recipes were different from Royal Thai. Royal Thai also had pretty lame curry, so I was excited to give Weera a try.\n\nI ordered the duck curry. It was listed on a sign outside as a \"special\" dish. It looked nice and red and yummy on the sign. When I got my duck curry, the look alone had me concerned. It was a light custardy yellow-beige color that looked nothing like the vibrant red promised. The flavor was equally disappointing - completely bland and lacking any of the complex spice profiles you'd expect from authentic Thai cuisine.\n\nThe duck itself was dry and overcooked, seeming like an afterthought rather than a carefully prepared protein. The vegetables were mushy and uninsp",

There were not only room charges but also other charges like ball room, meeting equipment, beverage, and so on. While believing we have paid for everything, today 6/6 I received this collection call from a collection agent. His name is Nelson. He said that it is reported to credit agency that $72.00 was unpaid. All the 16 rooms and all the expenses, thousands of dollars were paid, and this $72 claim is absolutely ridiculous!\n\nI immediately contacted the hotel's management and discovered this was a small incidental charge for a mini-bar item that was accidentally overlooked during the initial payment process. The customer service representative was helpful and quickly resolved the issue, removing the charge from our account. While the collection call was stressful,",

Didn't think it would be a big deal. When I walked in, the lady immediately told me that they close at 2:30 and handed me a menu as if I should order takeout. I asked, \"Can I eat here?\" and she said I could. I sat down, looked at the menu for maybe 1 minute, and she came by and wanted to take my order with an impatient tone. I felt rushed and uncomfortable. The service was so unwelcoming that it completely ruined my dining experience before I even took a bite. I understand they were close to closing, but 20 minutes before closing should still allow a customer to have a relaxed meal. Needless to say, I",

They let me sit where ever I want instead of just taking me to a table, nice though it does not effect my rating.\n\nI'm seated and I notice the \"Garage Doors\" Urban Architecture and simple Decor so I like this! It's got Potential! Plenty of Outdoor seating too, Great designs, this place is definitely a cool spot. The menu offers an interesting mix of contemporary dishes with some creative twists.

We were seated in a small room with 5 tables which was fine except that it was stuffy and a good look around the outdated room revealed a great deal of dust on rails etc. this of course makes you ask. What is the cleanliness in the kitchen? We had the tamales which was dry and the fois gras which was good. The squash was excellent and the spinach salad was excellent but way overdressed. We also had the lobster and basil pasta, which was disappointingly bland and lacked seasoning.\n\nThe overall dining experience was a mixed bag. While some dishes like the squash and spinach salad were delightful, others fell short of expectations. The ambiance was less than impressive, with cleanliness issues that raised concerns.

The suites are incredibly spacious, offering way more than a typical hotel room. You get a full living room, a completely equipped kitchen with a large fridge, stove, dishwasher, and microwave - perfect for longer stays or those who prefer home-cooked meals. The bathroom is massive, and the bedroom is equally roomy.\n\nPro tip: Request kitchen utensils from the front desk, as they don't come standard. If you're lucky, you might score a suite with a massive jacuzzi - as a tall person (6'2\"), I found it incredibly comfortable and relaxing.\n\nThe location is convenient, and the amenities are top-notch.

This is how it was ACTUALLY paid off: $13,000 was the trade in value that the dealership paid, $500 was essentially hidden fees that I was not informed about upfront. \n\nThe entire experience was frustrating and deceitful.

The bodyshop (whom I had a working relationship with as I am a former auto dealer) outsourced finding a replacement to Wheel Specialists. Wheel Specialists sent the body shop a replica M Parallel. The rim was obviously a replica as the lip was slightly different, the color was slightly different, and the rim lacked the OEM BMW markings. Getting an OEM rim was very important as the OEM rims are critical for maintaining the vehicle's performance, aesthetics, and resale value.\n\nI was extremely disappointed with Wheel Specialists' attempt to pass off a subpar replica as a genuine replacement.

Substitutions were made and chips with queso were ordered.\n\nI'm familiar with many styles of queso... but I was shocked by Pasqual's \"queso\" - it was more like a soft-spread, resembling something between processed cheese and a bland cream cheese.

According to the Enterprise website, a compact car is a Nissan Versa, a Toyota Yaris, or similar. Anything similar to those two cars would have suited our needs perfectly. When we arrived at the cars in the parking garage, I was told we would be in a Fiat 500. While I am sure the Fiat would have been fun to drive, it was much too small for our needs. Looking at the technical specifications for the Fiat 500, it was clear this vehicle was significantly smaller than what I had expected.\n\nThe staff was unhelpful when I expressed concerns, simply shrugging and saying this was \"what was available.\" I felt misled by their definition of a compact car.

I thought about going somewhere else or just coming back some other time, but instead I browsed some of the shoes I've been eyeballing online. I saw their foot analysis station, with a wait behind all those with the cross country people. When I finally got my turn, the staff was incredibly knowledgeable and patient. They took the time to analyze my gait, listen to my running goals, and recommend several options that would work perfectly for my marathon training. Despite the crowded store, they made me feel like I was their only customer. The shoes they suggested fit like a glove and were exactly what I needed.",

XS Nightclub at the Wynn is a mixed bag of experiences that epitomizes the Las Vegas nightlife scene. The venue is undeniably stunning, with impressive design and an opulent atmosphere that screams luxury.\n\nHowever, the club has significant drawbacks. The crowd density is overwhelming, to the point where movement becomes challenging and safety concerns are real. Bottle service, while expensive, does provide some breathing room and better access. The music tends to be repetitive, with DJs seemingly more focused on dropping beats than creating a cohesive experience.\n\nPricing is steep, even by Vegas standards, and the attitude can feel exclusionary. While the production value and initial wow factor are high, the actual clubbing experience can be underwhelming. It's a see-",

Before coming here, I was a fan of Yama Sushi, which is still really yummy, but now that I've been introduced to this place, I don't know...I think I might have to come here now rather than Yama. We arrived with a party of 6 and the hostess told us it would take about an hour and 15 minutes or so. The place is small with a main dining area and two larger tables to the side of the restaurant for larger parties.\n\nDespite the wait, the experience was totally worth it. The sushi was incredibly fresh, with standout rolls like the Las Vegas and Dragon rolls that literally melted in our mouths.

Okay that aside, the reason why were giving this event a 1 star (0 if possible) is the false advertisement to various ticket sellers. They proudly say \"trucks are asked to sell food on low price\" this is well printed and customer service even answer this question on their website. Well let me save you the precious time, money and save you from getting angry. Not only do you have to pay (12) dollars for entrance, you also have to pay parking (5).\n\nThe entire experience was a complete disappointment from start to finish. The food truck festival was nothing more than a money-grabbing scheme with overpriced entry, expensive parking, and food prices that were anything but \"low.\" The promised affordable cuisine was a complete fabrication.

They completely forgot over half of my cream cheese. Little irritated (and pregnant), I had to turn around and go back to the store.

        "Here's the review:\n\nWe had dinner here tonight for the first time. After reading several reviews in the paper about Liberty Market, and being fans of Joe's Farm Grill and Real BBQ, we were determined to get in here. We parked in the back and as we walked along the sidewalk next to Liberty Market we noticed the long line trailing out of Joe's Real BBQ and then noticed the crowd inside Liberty Market. I was instantly impressed that someone can be so successful in today's shaky market and open restaurant after restaurant with business just booming.\n\nAs we walked in we noticed that there was a line, but it moved quickly and efficiently. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, with rustic decor that felt both modern and nostalgic. The menu offered an impressive variety of fresh, locally sourced dishes that looked absolutely delicious. We ordered the roasted vegetable sandwich and the farm-to-table burger, both of which were incredibly",
        "My wife and I, along with a friend, decided to try this restaurant for our New Year's Eve dinner at 7:00.\n\nWhen we arrived at the hotel, we noticed that this is where Stanford U. was holding their pep rally. Place was buzzing with Red and White and shirts with large printed letter 'S' or 'STANFORD'.\n\nWalking down to the restaurant we were greeted and told it would be a minute. The staff and waiters were very cordial. The place was packed full of people and the noise level was overwhelming. Despite the crowd, our server managed to be attentive and efficient. The menu offered an impressive selection of dishes with creative twists on classic favorites. We ordered the roasted duck and seafood risotto, both of which were beautifully presented and deliciously prepared. The wine pairing recommended by our sommelier complemented our meals perfectly. While the prices were on the higher side, the",
        "Here's the review:\n\nThis was my first and last experience at the Vintage. My friend and I were looking for a place to eat lunch on a late Sunday afternoon. We found a coupon for buy 1 lunch and get 1 free so we thought we could get some really nice food at a decent price. The experience was horrible from the start. We walked in and it was not busy at all. We had to wait about 3-5 minutes before the hostess returned from the bathroom to greet us and seat us. While waiting the bartender awkwardly looked over but did not offer to help and two other staff members saw us standing there and did nothing.\n\nOnce seated, the service continued to be painfully slow. Our waiter seemed disinterested and took nearly 20 minutes to take our order. The food was mediocre at best - my sandwich was dry and cold, and my friend's salad looked like it",
        "Here's the review:\n\nThe boyfriend finally agreed to go out for breakfast and this made me beyond happy. The place: Rise and Shine in Southern Highlands. Very quaint, family-run breakfast/lunch spot.\n\nWe arrived just after 11 and had a 20 min wait. Thank goodness for the gorgeous Fall weather. Our name was finally called and a 10-13 year old brought us to our table. Normally, the idea of children working in a restaurant annoys me. Restaurants is a serious business and throwing your underaged kids in the mix is more distracting than it is helpful. But this kid was surprisingly professional! He seated us efficiently, knew the menu, and even made a cute joke about the daily special.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious - my boyfriend's eggs benedict was perfectly prepared, and my Belgian waffle was crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. The portion sizes were generous,",
        "Here's the review:\n\nDear Mr. Sushi,\n\nI have been to this restaurant numerous times and I have enjoyed your bento boxes, sushi, salad, and soups. I was hoping to come here twice last week on different lunch dates, but as you were closed, I was unable to. I understand that business is slow when the school year is done and spring term exams are over, however in light of recent events, it has been made clear to me that you do not care about your loyal customers. I wanted to take some friends to Mr. Sushi on August 27, 2014.\n\nWhat happened that day was unacceptable. Not only were you closed without any prior notice, but when I called to inquire about your hours, no one even bothered to return my call. The lack of communication and customer service is deeply disappointing. For a restaurant that once prided itself on quality and consistency, this experience",
        "Here's the review:\n\nI was looking forward to their opening and now I feel I need to wait a few months longer before I try again. On a Friday night, the service was disappointingly unprofessional and disorganized. After waiting 5 minutes just to be acknowledged, the hostess's first question was whether we were planning to order food, warning us of an absurdly long kitchen wait time exceeding an hour. The entire interaction felt unwelcoming and rushed.\n\nWhile the space looked promising and the beer selection seemed interesting, the initial experience was far from impressive. The staff's lack of enthusiasm and apparent inability to manage their kitchen's workflow was a major turnoff. It seemed like they were more interested in turning tables than providing a quality dining experience.\n\nI might give them another chance in the future, hoping they'll work out their operational kinks, but for now, I'm hesitant to recommend this establishment to anyone seeking a relaxe",
        "Here's the review:\n\nSunday morning in the casino at the Palms is like being in God's waiting room. Having said that, it seems that the Palms is either a property with a 3-way split personality or it's having an identity crisis. Or both.\n\nI see 3 distinct things going on here: They clearly market and cater to the older local population, evidenced by crowds toting the most recent giveaway, which happened to be bathrobes. Yes, bathrobes. Meanwhile, the nightclub scene tries desperately to appeal to a much younger, hipper crowd with pulsing music and overpriced cocktails. The casino floor itself feels stuck somewhere in between - neither genuinely exciting nor completely relaxed.\n\nThe slot machines are decent, the staff is friendly enough, but there's an underlying sense of confusion about what this place wants to be. It's not terrible, but it's not great either",
        "Review for second experience only.\n\nI had such an amazing experience at Lawry's the first time I was there that I had to reserve to dine again for my birthday this past weekend. The second time around was not as satisfying as the first.\n\nWhat went wrong? Unfortunately, several key aspects of the dining experience fell short of my expectations. The bread arrived cold, which immediately set a disappointing tone for the meal. Our waiter failed to communicate additional charges upfront, creating an unpleasant surprise when the bill arrived. Most critically, my prime rib - ordered medium rare - was overcooked and disappointingly tough. After just four bites, I was genuinely frustrated with the quality of the meat.\n\nGiven my previous exceptional visit, this experience was particularly disheartening. While Lawry's has proven capable of excellence, this meal was a significant letdown that left me questioning whether their previous high standards have slipped.",
        "We (5 of us) went into McFaddens on 3/19/14 at approximately 7:13, we were sat and 10 mins went by and nobody saw us. I check the time because I'm a server myself and know about seeing people within 90 secs and we were pressed for time because we were going to a concert. So I went up to bar, after another 3 mins the bartender asked what I need and I said no one has seen us and it's been a while. The bartender came out and offered us drinks, I said we needed to order and eat quickly.\n\nThe service was incredibly slow and disorganized. Despite my attempt to explain our time constraints, the staff seemed disinterested and unprofessional. The food took forever to arrive, and when it did, it was lukewarm and barely edible.

This Rock Bottom brewery might be a good place start.\n\nI sampled their IPA and amber ale, and while neither knocked my socks off, they were solid midrange craft brews. The IPA had a decent hop profile with subtle citrus undertones, but lacked the complexity I've tasted at other local breweries. Their amber ale was smoother, with a nice caramel maltiness that made it more drinkable.\n\nThe bar itself has a classic sports pub vibe - lots of wood, big screen TVs, and a comfortable atmosphere. Prices are reasonable, especially during happy hour when draft beers are discounted. Service was prompt, and the bartender seemed knowledgeable about their beer selection.\n\nWoul",
        "Bank of America was my first bank after switching from a credit union. I banked with them for a couple years. A few months after I turned 18, they told me in the branch that I was approved for a student credit card to be used for overdraft protection. I thought that was great bc I was still learning to balance a checkbook and hardly ever had more than $200 in my account at a time. I filled out all the paper work and the teller said it would be applied right away as a back up. Well, that didn't happen.\n\nInstead, what followed was a nightmare of hidden fees, miscommunication, and frustration. Despite being promised immediate overdraft protection, I was hit with multiple overdraft charges totaling over $300 in just a few months. The customer service was abysmal, with representatives giving conflicting information and showing zero empathy. When I tried to resolve the issue, I was bounced between different departments",
        "Here's the review:\n\nDon't go here for your banking. Their customer service is terrible and they are incompetent. \\n\\nI wanted to get away from the big banks because I'd heard that the smaller banks, like credit unions, were better. So far, they are no better. In fact, the customer service at Bank of America was WAY better; at least I could get a live person whenever I needed it. Reaching a live person at this credit union is next to impossible in my experience. My impression is that they prefer that you either take care of what you need through their automated system or online portal.\n\nWhen I did finally get through to a representative, they were unhelpful and seemed completely disinterested in resolving my issue. The wait times are excessive, and their phone system is frustratingly complex. The online banking interface is clunky and difficult to navigate. Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere for your banking needs",
        "Here's the completed review:\n\nI usually love Maggiano's and visit at least once a month but my lunch experience today has made me hesitant to visit again. My boyfriend and I made a lunch reservation to celebrate his promotion at work. We arrived and noticed the reservation wasn't necessary in the less than half full restaurant. Still, we were seated in a terrible table situated next to the kitchen doors and a server station and next to a large party. Not the quiet romantic lunch we had hoped for. It was all downhill from there. Our server was pushy and unattentive. Whenever myself or my boyfriend tried to discuss something, he would interrupt with upselling recommendations or rush us to order. The food, which I've always enjoyed in the past, seemed rushed and lukewarm. Our pasta dishes lacked seasoning, and the portion sizes seemed smaller than previous visits. The final blow was the excessive 20% gratuity automatically added to",
        "Sorry. Can't give this place more than 2 stars for a couple reasons. First time I came here, the waitress was really sweet, but forgot to put in my boyfriend's order for a shake, and neither of us were that terribly excited about the food we did receive, especially for the price. Also, I realize it may be hotel policy, but they wouldn't honor our Harrah's comp voucher unless we charged the meal to the room.\n\nSecond time, I go to place a to-go order for a burger and fries. Hostess says I need to wait 20 minutes, which seemed excessive for a simple order. When the food finally arrived, the burger was lukewarm and the fries were soggy. The bun was stale, and the meat tasted like it had been sitting under heat lamps for hours. Customer service was indifferent, and no one seemed interested in addressing my concerns. For",
        "Here's the review:\n\nI'd give this company location no stars if possible.\n\nOn Thursday, March 21 I arrived to pick up a car I'd reserved over a week prior. The king of the Enterprise rental counter, whose name I wish I'd gotten so that I could name and shame him, had a terrible, condescending attitude right off the bat. It's one thing if your reason for not honoring my reservation is some wonky company policy, but it's quite another to talk down to me in a smarmy voice, be needlessly difficult, and act like I'm inconveniencing him by expecting the service I paid for in advance.\n\nNot only did they not have my reserved vehicle, but they tried to upsell me to a more expensive option and then claimed they had \"no cars available\" at my original reservation rate. The entire experience was unprofessional, frustrating, and a complete waste of my time. I",

I found this place on yelp and decided to check it out. It's a fairly new place and less than 10 minutes from the strip.\n\nAs soon as we entered, they greeted us and offered us bottled water while we filled out an info card. Very nice and clean place! They start off by washing your hair and giving you an incredible 5-10 minute scalp massage that was absolutely heavenly. The stylists were super friendly and knew exactly how to style my hair for a night out. I opted for voluminous curls that held up perfectly throughout our wild evening. The pricing was reasonable for Vegas, and the entire experience was quick and professional. I'll definitely be returning next time I'm in town and need a glam hair moment before hitting",

The front desk, though staffed by incredibly friendly personnel, suffers from significant wait times. Each check-in process took between 6-10 minutes, which can be frustrating for weary travelers.\n\nOn the bright side, the pool areas are absolutely stunning. Heated pools, comfortable lounge chairs, and plentiful towels create a luxurious atmosphere. The multiple bars around the pool area are strategically placed (and clearly profitable, with those $10 cocktails). Despite the minor check-in inconvenience, the hotel's amenities and overall quality make it a top-notch destination for those seeking comfort and relaxation.",

The crust was bland and slightly undercooked, lacking that crisp edge that makes a great pizza. The ham seemed sparse, and the arugula wilted quickly, losing its fresh punch. While the aesthetic was Instagram-worthy - clean lines, cool lighting, and trendy decor - the food fell flat. The beer selection was",
        "Here's a review continuing from where you left off:\n\nLas Vegas is known for The Strip, several miles of massive resort casinos that will do just about anything to catch a visitor's attention. City Center complex is no exception.\n\nThis ultra modern, sleek design mixed use area is home to the Mandarin Oriental hotel. Upon entering the MO, guests travel up to the twenty-third floor to the Sky Lobby a refreshingly unique concept. However the Tea Lounge is just sort of there by the check-in desk. It has all the charm of a Starbucks kiosk in any lobby in any hotel in any major city in the world.\n\nDespite the underwhelming tea area, the hotel's overall aesthetic is stunning. Floor-to-ceiling windows offer breathtaking views of the Las Vegas skyline, and the rooms are impeccably designed with minimalist elegance. The staff is professional and attentive, making up",

We took our car around back and was able to park right in front of our hotel room.\n\nThe basic room was spacious, with two Queen sized beds, bathroom/shower, TV, refrigerator, of course AC and wi-fi. We loved our stay at this no-frills but comfortable hotel. The staff was friendly and check-in was smooth. Parking was super convenient, and the room felt clean and well-maintained.

        "Here's the review:\n\nCame here with my boyfriend last weekend for a living social deal we got, which was a total steal! It was $199 for Friday 3pm -Sunday 1pm in a suite with a King Size bed (plus 100 bucks towards the spa, 2 free breakfast buffets, and 6 free bowling games). Didn't really know what to expect because we've never stayed anywhere in Vegas except for the strip.\n\nOverall, we were pleasantly surprised that this place was pretty nice! The hotel itself is pretty modern and luxurious for the price we paid. The room was spacious, clean, and had an incredible view of the surrounding mountains. The king-sized bed was super comfortable, and the bathroom was spotless with high-end toiletries. We loved using the spa credit for massages, and the bowling alley was a fun unexpected bonus.

I went because it got good reviews, it was new to me and it was Mexican food which was what I wanted today. Big surprise - fantastic food.\n\nThe restaurant is not in a swanky neighborhood but don't let that stop you. They are in a shopping center that has several other restaurants, some closed, and a sports bar. Look for it because it is not obvious.\n\nFrom the pictures on Yelp you might think they do not have many seating options, but the interior is actually quite spacious and welcoming. The staff was incredibly friendly, and the salsa was fresh and zesty. I ordered the carnitas, and they were perfectly seasoned - tender, crispy in just the right spots, and served with homemade tortillas that were clearly made with love. Prices are reasonable, and the portion sizes",

Perhaps because the restaurant is newly opened and the menu hasn't been perfected (well, that is still no excuse for overcooking beef)?\n\nUnlike the other low rating reviewer - service was really good for us. Ambiance and table seating and arrangement was also not an issue. The only problem we had was entirely on the food.\n\nI like the different tasting dishes but sometimes it felt really disjointed and confused, as if the kitchen was struggling to find a cohesive culinary vision. The proteins were particularly problematic - my medium-rare steak arrived well-done and dry, lacking any of the promised tenderness. While the presentation was elegant, the execution fell short of expectations.\n\nThe experimental flavor combinations, though creative, often missed the mark, feeling more like culinary experiments gone",

I would give the restaurant 2.5 stars, the bakery 4 stars and meat market 5+stars.\n\nI've only eaten at the restaurant once; my Mom and her husband love this place - so on her recommendation a couple friends and I went for a prime rib dinner. My friends and I are not young, but we were the youngest people there. No problem, it was 8pm and we were starving. We each ordered the prime rib dinner which came with soup, potato, and vegetables.\n\nThe prime rib was decent but not exceptional. The soup was lukewarm and bland, and the sides were uninspired. Service was slow and our server seemed disinterested. However, the meat market is a completely different story - their cuts are phenomenal, incredibly fresh, and reasonably",
        "Here's the review:\n\nThis is close to my house when I need to pick up something in a pinch, like jasmine rice, soy sauce or rice vinegar. Being Thai, I find that they lack a lot of Thai ingredients. Mostly pre-packaged curries and bottled sauces and that's it. However, they do have lots of Korean and Indian items.\n\nThe produce section is nice, but disappointing for authentic Thai cooking. No kaffir lime leaves or galangal, and lemongrass is hit-or-miss. They do have nice fresh herbs like garlic and Chinese varieties, which is a plus. While not a comprehensive ethnic market, it serves as a convenient neighborhood grocery store for basic pantry staples.\n\nPrices are reasonable, and the store is always clean and well-organized. The staff is friendly and helpful, making quick shopping trips pleasant. It's not a destination for specialized ingredients, but",

First, you go in, and stand in line (McDonalds style) to order a burger and drinks. Wait staff are shuffling next to you and jostling to get by. You're standing in line being jostled on one side and have a loud kitchen in the other. You pay for your food. You sit and wait. The burgers weren't great. The meat was gummy and had the feel of biting into some gelatinous gooey meat like substance.\n\nThe fries were equally disappointing - limp and under-seasoned, with that sad, soggy quality that screams \"frozen and poorly reheated\". The drink selection was limited, and my soda tasted watered down. The entire dining experience felt chaotic and uncomfortable, with no real sense of customer service or culinary",

My girlfriend was given a plate with a hair on it. Probably our waitress. Glad I caught it. But you gotta be careful of that sort of thing. Only one waitress for the whole restaurant buuuut she seemed overwhelmed and stressed. The food itself was mediocre at best - the pad thai was bland and the spring rolls were greasy.

No matter how many old black & white pictures of the Rat Pack and lounge acts they paste on the walls, this isn't a classic trip back to the \"glory days\" of mob Vegas. Try the the Plaza or Sahara for true nostalgia. The Thunderbird is more where you'd end up after Vegas stole your money, stole your lady, stole your heart but left your liver. A place where broken dreams and cheap whiskey mix like a toxic cocktail of desperation.\n\nThe bartenders here don't judge; they've seen it all.

Not bad.\n\nCaesar salad: Very fresh and crispy. For the price of $13 though? It really was a slab of romaine lettuce with some parmesan shavings and a drizzle of dressing.

We normally play there either Sunday mornings or nights and Wed nights. If you want to join us and play look up Las Vegas Street Hockey on the Internet. The rink can get slippery due to some sand coming into it from the volleyball sand pit.\n\nThe park offers plenty of amenities beyond the hockey rink, including clean restrooms, picnic areas, and well-maintained walking paths.

They're all available somewhere in Scottsdale, but you can find the famous Bacon Bloody Mary here at Bacon.\n\nThis is a cool space for a breakfast spot, with indoor-outdoor seating and lots of light. Our server, who seemed to be a bit overworked since he was the only waiter, was very friendly and welcoming. We ordered the bacon flight and their signature breakfast sandwich, both of which were phenomenal.

The sun-dried tomato hummus was by far our favorite, but the others were delicious as well.

I watched the 3 younger Hispanic guys watch my partner reach for the trey and yet again start giggling and whispering. The entire experience was incredibly uncomfortable and unprofessional.

They also had bar bingo which was a sure fire way to get drunk for under $15. Recently, a lot of friends were raving about the pizza, which I have had a few times before. I remember it being what I call \"bar pizza\". Pizza that is doey and fluffy, tastes good when you are sober but even better when you are drunk, however at the end of the day, it's nothing special. The crust is passable, the toppings are standard, and while it hits the spot after a few drinks, it's not something I'd go out of my way to eat.

First time I ate at one in California I was blown away by the portion size (so big that they were serving apples on the plates) and also by the taste of the food. Their prime rib is absolutely delicious, and second favourite of mine is the rotisserie chicken - especially with their barbecue sauce. In fact, if you get any steak there, get that BBQ sauce and slather it on - it's wonderful.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual and welcoming, perfect for families or groups of friends. What truly sets Claim Jumper apart is their commitment to quality and consistency. Every dish feels like a hearty, home-cooked meal, but with professional culinary expertise. The varied menu means there's something for everyone, from massive salads to decadent desserts. Prices are surprisingly reasonable considering the enormous portions, making it an",
        "Here's the review:\n\nStopped in here on Saturday with G money. The host was pretty cool in finding us a table around the bar so we didn't have to go up and down any steps. Our server, Alysha (sp?) was one of the best servers I think I've ever had. If you've ever been to Applebees before you know the menu is pretty standard, but with a few cool dishes thrown in. The drink menu also has some nice looking selections on it. I'm not totally crazy about fruity drinks but the red apple sangria looked and sounded good. If I could give this location six stars, I totally would. The atmosphere was relaxed, the music wasn't too loud, and the food came out quickly. We ordered the boneless wings and the classic burger, both of which were cooked perfectly. Prices were reasonable, and the overall experience was fantastic. Definitely recommend this spot for a casual dinner or",
        "Here's the review:\n\nI've shopped here for years, but had a recent bad experience. Planning a party and ordering the food should not be such a hostile experience. Their ad says they can have the food ready for catering in 2 days, I showed up to order over a week before the event was due--in total 9 days prior. I waited a long time only to be greeted by Emily who was upset her lunch was interrupted (it was 1:30) and I did apologize taking her away from her meal, but she was clearly not happy. She made us wait longer for her to finish eating, then seemed annoyed when discussing our catering order. The entire interaction was unprofessional and made me feel unwelcome. Her attitude completely overshadowed any potential quality of their food. For a business that claims to specialize in catering, their customer service was shockingly poor. I won't be returning or",

I admit that outright.\n\nI usually give 4s and 5s. I'm one of those people who has positive things to say about just about anywhere...but not here. Don't get me wrong--I have no problem with this individual location. I have been trying to order something site-to-store from the parent company website for three days. First, they advertised it as one price but as soon as it went into my cart, the price mysteriously changed. Their customer service is absolutely abysmal\u2014multiple chat representatives gave me conflicting information, and their phone support is like navigating a labyrinth of frustration.\n\nThe website is poorly designed, buggy, and seems intentionally complicated.

The prices are absolutely ridiculous for the quality you're getting.\n\nThe ambiance tries to be upscale, but falls flat with mediocre decor and cramped seating.

And kids 12 and under pay half ($17), whereas other buffet places, such as Bellagio, you have to pay full price for kids.\n\nThe food selections are great... not too overwhelming like some other places where it has all kinds of dishes for all types of cuisines, but most of them you won't even bother to touch or try anyway. This place has enough selections of American, Chinese, and seafood to keep everyone happy. The prime rib was perfectly cooked - tender and juicy, and the crab legs were fresh and delicious. I especially loved the made-to-order stir-fry station where you can customize your own dish. The dessert section was also impressive, with everything",

My BF wasn't very hungry, so he chose something from the \"small plate\" section of the menu, which, as it was explained to us, was similar to Tapas style. Since I was very hungry, I ordered \"slow cooked salmon\" from the \"large plate\" section of the menu. When the orders arrived, I was shocked and disappointed. His \"small plate\" was literally the size of a silver dollar, and my \"large plate\" salmon was barely bigger than a deck of cards! For the astronomical prices at this restaurant, the portion sizes were an absolute joke. The presentation was fancy, but the quantity was laughable. We left still hungry and $80 poorer.

My body was craving hydration and something fresh and cold.\n\nInstead of our usual apres-tennis East Boulevard lunch haunts, my husband and I checked out Something Classic Cafe. (Home of the gourmet TV dinner which I will get to in a moment.)\n\nI got the salad trio with the chicken salad, and it was absolutely refreshing! The chicken was perfectly seasoned, not too mayo-heavy, and had just the right texture. The presentation was charming, with each salad nestled in its own compartment. My husband went for their signature gourmet TV dinner, which arrived in a nostalgic aluminum tray and taste",

I found him to be a bag of douche of galactic proportions.\n\nI suppose this place is OK for average bikes needing average repairs, but when I brought in my road bike for a repair of moderate difficulty for any competent bike shop, because the owner was incapable of doing the repair he chose to insult me by telling me I should sell my bike and get something more appropriate for someone of my physique.\n\nAt the moment I'm a little overweight, but here's the facts: every summer I road bike 500-700 miles, training hard and pushing my limits. His unprofessional and body-shaming comments were not only inappropriate but completely uncalled for. The shop lacks basic customer service skills, and the owner's attitude is toxic.

So this what we ordered and shared:\n\n1st dish: Tofu and Soy Chorizo burrito...oh man, this was awesome. The burrito was perfectly spiced and tasty. I'm sure that any non-vegan would have never guessed that this was a vegan dish... it was that good. The chorizo was da bomb! The dish even came with tofu.\n\nThe restaurant's atmosphere is super welcoming, and the staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about their menu.

Even though the place was packed and there was a line out the door, we were seated in less than 10 minutes and the service was excellent.\n\nHaving lived in New Mexico for about 5 years, I've learned a lot about green chile. I've also learned that more often than not, when you visit a restaurant serving green chile outside of New Mexico, their idea of \"hot\" is what we would call less than mild in NM. So, I was pleasantly surprised when the green chile sauce here actually had some real kick! The enchiladas were authentic, loaded with flavor, and the chile had that perfect balance of heat and depth that reminded me of home. The portions were generous, the atmosphere was warm and festive, and the staff seemed genuinely happy to be serving customers on Christmas. Definitely a hidden gem that I",

The bed was incredibly comfortable, with crisp white linens and plenty of plush pillows. The bathroom featured marble countertops and high-end toiletries that made me feel pampered. The view from my window overlooked the city, providing a stunning panorama that was especially beautiful at sunset.\n\nThe staff were consistently professional and attentive. From the front desk to housekeeping, everyone seemed committed to ensuring guests have a pleasant experience. I was particularly impressed by how quickly they responded to a small request I made about extra towels.\n\nWhile the location is convenient, the real charm is in the hotel's understated elegance. It's not trying to be flashy or over-the-top, just a solid, reliable place to stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a",
        "Here's the review:\n\nThis place is a real gem for those who like to geek out or are true history buffs (that would include my son and husband). The National Atomic Testing Museum and Area 51 exhibit is a fascinating blend of science, history, and quirky conspiracy theories that kept our entire family entertained.\n\nThe Area 51 section was particularly amusing, with its over-the-top alien displays and electronic sound effects that had the kids giggling. While some exhibits might seem a bit cheesy, they're actually quite engaging and spark interesting conversations about UFO theories and government mysteries.\n\nThe museum's exhibits are well-curated and provide a unique perspective on Nevada's scientific and military history. We appreciated the educational value mixed with fun interactive elements. The Groupon deal we found made the experience even better - just $48 for five people was an incredible bargain.\n\nDefinitely recommend for families, history enthusiasts, and anyone",
        "So... I don't live in Montreal but I relied on this grocery store to supply me with some breakfasts, lunches and snacks, while I was visiting from Boston. Not being from the area, I am not sure how well priced the groceries are here, but most things seemed pretty over-priced (at least compared to similar grocery stores in the Boston area). I was seriously in shock over the price of the M&Ms. Almost $5 for a small bag?! They have their own President's Choice brand, which was more reasonable than name brands and the items that I tried were actually quite good. The produce section looked fresh, and the staff seemed friendly enough. The store was clean and well-organized, which was a plus. While the prices were definitely higher than I'm used to, the convenience and selection made it workable for a short-term visitor like myself. If you're a local, you might find better deals elsewhere, but",

When I arrived the hostess was rude and pretended that I didn't exist until she realized that I wasn't going away. We were sat quite quickly, but it took nearly 15 minutes before our waiter came to take a drink order. I ordered one of their signature drinks and was pleased when it arrived. Our waiter brought out bread and herb butter, but the butter was nearly frozen and impossible to spread over the cold bread. I was a little taken back by the pricing on the menu, which seemed excessive for the portion sizes. The main course was underwhelming - my steak was overcooked and lacked seasoning. While the restaurant looks trendy, the overall dining experience fell short of expectations. I expected much more given the restaurant's reputation and high prices. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this place to others.",

I have two of my own so of course when I found out that this was being built directly across from the school I work at, I was there for the grand opening and several times since. There are two gated areas, one for small dogs and one for big dogs. I have to go to the small dog one as I have 2 small dogs.\n\nI gave it 4 stars because there is always a shortage of waste bags when I go and it is a little smaller than I would have liked. My dogs don't seem to mind the size, though, and they absolutely love running around and playing with other pups. The ground is well-maintained, with wood chips that are regularly replaced, and there are plenty of shaded areas for hot days. The fencing is secure, which gives me peace of mind. The location is super convenient, and the other dog owners are",

Having lived in Hawaii and Los Angeles, and frequenters of Ippudo in New York, you can consider us ramen fiends.\n\nThe ramen at this spot was surprisingly legit! The tonkotsu broth was rich and creamy, with a depth of flavor that transported us right back to some of our favorite ramen joints. The noodles were perfectly cooked - springy and with just the right amount of bite. Gyoza were crisp and well-seasoned, and the kimchi fried rice packed a delightful punch of spice. The pork belly bowl was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the mini mentaiko bowl added a nice oceanic umami touch.\n\nWhile the prices were a bit steep, the quality and authenticity made it worth every penny.

        "Here's the review:\n\nThe wait for a walk in was 2 hours. I just came in for an x ray because my wisdom teeth were coming in. I figured it was going to be an easy visit but then they talked me into extracting a tooth by saying it would only cost $93, I don't know there are complications so that will be $165. I figure what the hell I'm already here I already waited might as well go through with it... Bad idea. Keep in mind these are dental students not actual dentists, so they really are not that experienced especially when it came to the procedure.\n\nThe extraction was a nightmare. The student was visibly nervous and seemed unsure of what to do. The process was painfully slow and uncomfortable, with multiple attempts to remove the tooth. I ended up with more pain and swelling than I expected, and the aftercare instructions were vague and unhelpful. The final bill was much higher than initially",
        "Here's the review:\n\nReviewing just the casino. And that's quite enough.\n\nPalace Station is a no-frills gambling spot that embodies the local Vegas experience. The casino floor feels dated but functional, with a mix of slot machines and table games that attract a more budget-conscious crowd. Dealers are competent and somewhat friendly, though not overly warm. The slot machines seemed reasonably tight, which wasn't a pleasant surprise for someone hoping for those \"loose slots\" locals supposedly know about.\n\nThe atmosphere is distinctly no-nonsense - think practical rather than glamorous. Table minimums are indeed lower than the Strip casinos, which could be a draw for more casual gamblers. While it's not going to win any design awards or compete with the flashier casino resorts, Palace Station serves its purpose as a straightforward gambling destination for those seeking a more low-key gaming experience.\n\nNot spectacular, but serviceable.",

Seriously, I've NEVER had an experience like the one I had a few weeks ago.\n\nI went in on a Sunday morning and from the very first moment was barraged with three different people trying to get me to 1) realize I need to wax every three weeks or else and 2) should be signing up for a waxing package immediately. So I was already pretty turned off before I even got in the waxing room.\n\nBut then the real \"fun\" started. The waxing technician was rough, impatient, and seemed completely disinterested in providing any level of comfort. The waxing itself was excruciatingly painful, with strips ripped off carelessly and multiple attempts on the same area. The room was cold, the service was impersonal, and I left feeling more traumatized than groome",
        "Best Buffet in Las Vegas. Period.\n\nThis culinary paradise absolutely delivers on variety and flavor, despite the somewhat limited seafood selection. While the crab might not satisfy hardcore shellfish enthusiasts like myself, the overall dining experience more than makes up for it. The sushi station offers impressively fresh rolls, and the clams/mussels/shrimp bar is a genuine highlight. I was particularly impressed by the innovative hot dishes - the Tomato/Corn Risotto was creamy and delightful, and the \"Angry Mac n' Cheese\" packed a serious punch of flavor. The lamb was tender and perfectly seasoned, proving that buffet food can be far from bland. The seared salmon and trout salad were solid options, and the salty fishy crostini added an interesting texture to the meal. While seafood lovers might want to temper their expectations, this buffet offers an incredible range of",

For entrees, I selected the roasted chicken, a Keller signature, and found it surprisingly underwhelming. The skin wasn't as crisp as expected, and the meat was slightly dry. My companion's sea bass was more successful, with a delicate texture and well-balanced accompaniments.\n\nThe wine list was extensive, but prices were predictably high for a celebrity chef restaurant. Service was professional but somewhat detached, lacking the warmth one might expect at this price point. Dessert - a chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me - was the meal's highlight, rich and smooth with perfect consistency.\n\nWhile not a terrible dining experience, Bouchon fell short of the elevated expectations associated with Thomas Keller's reputation. At these prices, one hopes for more consistency and excitement. Decent, but",

Computer was purchased not quite two years ago with warranty on it. Needed service as hard drive supposedly crashed...Well after 3weeks of supposed service and transfer my computer was trash.. Windows 7 was corrupt, only a portion of files transferred, and the programs that were on the computer when I purchased it, which is why I purchased that one, are no longer on it. so in addition to paying the 70.00 transfer service, I had to pay another 200.00 to reinstall the original software. Their technical support was completely incompetent and seemed more interested in charging me additional fees than actually resolving my issue.

He quickly tells us about their wines and walks away. We flag him down and ask for the sommelier. Our waiter comes back after several minutes and takes our drink order. Drinks were great but after that, everything went downhill.\n\nThe food was mediocre at best, especially considering the high prices.

My group decided to check it out and was very disappointed. For $10 you get to stand in a short line that takes forever because there are security guards frisking you and ruffling through your pockets and belongings. You then proceed to the ballroom where the seats are arranged in a clever circular octagon formation, facing several large screen projectors. It looked cool until you try to find a seat and realize the layout is a total nightmare. Visibility is terrible, with people constantly standing up, blocking views, and creating a chaotic environment. The sound quality was mediocre, and the crowded space made it impossible to enjoy the fight comfortably. Save your money and watch the UFC at a sports bar with better atmosphere and less hassle.",

Even at a little after 8am, there was a freak storm hovering nearby so we had some concerns with \"surviving\" the trail and getting back in time before getting fully rained on. To our relief, the hike was easy as pie and had little elevation gain, but we did encounter one small problem. We were talking and missed a turn and ended up adding another trail and a half or so to our loop.\n\nDespite our accidental detour, the trail was absolutely stunning.

It was perfectly \"meh.\" Being the first opening of a major resort and casino since I've moved here, I was excited to see what it would be like. I really didn't like the design, and left confused about how they could have spent so much money on something so uninspired.\n\nThe casino floor felt cramped and dated, despite being brand new. The color scheme was bizarre - a mix of dull grays and awkward burgundy tones that made the space feel more like a dated 1990s conference center than a modern resort.

The promised 10-minute wait stretched into a 30-minute ordeal, and things only went downhill from there. After being seated, we waited an excruciating 45 minutes for our food with zero communication from our waitress. No check-ins, no updates, nothing. When the food finally arrived, it was literally just dumped on our table without any explanation for the massive delay.\n\nThe restaurant's interior is charming, and some dishes showed genuine culinary potential.

Money down the drain for the next few weeks until I go and have to spend another 300 for a new ombre since half of mine was cut off.\n\nThe girl cutting my hair was a really nice girl, but nice doesn't equal skill.

I would think they would at least open the doors, but nope. So that was a bad start. It took our waitress a long time to even come to our table, and when she came she asked if we wanted drinks and apps (which we didn't given the lackluster atmosphere). The food was equally disappointing - my burger was overcooked and dry, and the BF's salmon looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours.

It honestly doesn't seem to matter if we order right off the menu or if we ask for a small change to our order - something basic will always be missing (like lettuce) or done incorrectly when the food arrives.\n\nThe customer service has also dramatically declined.

Credit where it's due: the staff is exceptionally friendly, quickly clearing plates and ensuring drink refills are prompt. The buffet itself remains consistently stocked, with no empty trays in sight.\n\nHowever, the food quality is where this establishment falls dramatically short. The sushi rolls are a particular disappointment, drowning in an overwhelming amount of imitation crab-like slaw that completely overshadows any potential flavor. Each roll seems more like a vehicle for this mysterious, mayonnaise-heavy concoction than a carefully crafted piece of cuisine.\n\nWhile the restaurant's service and organization are commendable, the culinary experience leaves much to be desired.

        "Here's the review:\n\nLet me start off by saying I did not choose to have this company attempt to fix my clothes dryer.....they were contracted by my home warranty. My trouble started last December. On 12/19/11, my dryer broke. My warranty company contracted Avalon for the repair. On the 23rd when I still haven't heard anything from them, I called their office. I was informed they never received any notification from the warranty company. After going back and forth for a couple of hours, they scheduled a service appointment for the 28th!!!\n\nThe entire experience was frustrating and unprofessional. Their communication was terrible, and the scheduling process was painfully slow. When the technician finally arrived, he seemed disinterested and rushed through the diagnosis. The repair took longer than expected, and I was left without a working dryer during the holiday season. Their customer service was lacking, and I would not recommen",
        "Here's a review based on the partial text you provided:\n\nI've driven past this place many times and always made a mental note to try it out. I had a sushi craving today and thought why the hell not?\n\nThe good: I walked in and was impressed by the decor. It was warm and inviting and the hostess was nice.\n\nAnd that's where it ends.\n\nThe bad: I was seated and sat there for a good five minutes before I was even approached by a server to take my drink order. 3 of them walked right past me multiple times. And there were plenty of open tables, so it wasn't like they were slammed.\n\nWhen I finally got someone's attention, the service was painfully slow. My sushi took nearly 40 minutes to arrive, and when it did, it was barely lukewarm. The rolls looked hastily prepared, with uneven cuts and sloppy presentation. The",
        "Here's the review:\n\nAm a little late on this update as it's about our Fathers Day Brunch experience and that was a few weeks ago but, still felt compelled to type. Went to brunch with my wife, her sister, and their parents. The brunch menu was pretty extensive and covered an App, Entree and Dessert for $35.\n\nFirst good news. Not being a dessert person, I asked if I could sub two apps instead of one app and one dessert. \"It's fathers day sir, absolutely no problem\".\n\nSecond good news. Just incredible food across the board. The crab cake appetizer was perfectly crisp with a delicate, fresh flavor that set the tone for the meal. My wife's salmon was cooked to perfection - moist and flaky. The service was attentive without being intrusive, and the staff's flexibility made the experience feel personalized. At $35",
        "Here's the review:\n\nWhen we got here there was a lot of people waiting and we checked in and sat down within 15 minutes. Not bad for a full restaraunt. Once we were seated are very attentive waitress Mary came and it was like 'BANG BANG BANG' Seriously. She was good! She got our drinks, took our orders, got a banana nut muffins and about 10 minutes or less later, our food was out at our table. How awesome was that? They are really organized or the cooks are secretly Superman or have some sort of secret powers.\n\nThe food was equally impressive - my breakfast combo was hot, fresh, and perfectly seasoned. The eggs were cooked just right, and the bacon was crispy without being burnt. The banana nut muffin was a delightful bonus, moist and packed with flavor. The prices were reasonable, and the overall atmosphere",
        "Here's the review:\n\nWhat up, Big Dog!? \ud83c\udf1f\n\nI'll tell you what's up, this place is my IDEAL coffee shop. Literally. Figuratively. In my dreams. In Pittsburgh. In my Pittsburgh dreams.\n\nWhy, you ask?\n\nWell, I'll list out the what's what:\n\n*A customizable OATMEAL BAR. Yes! Oatmeal with all the fixins: brown sugar, walnuts, chocolate chips, dried fruit and more....! A perfect alternative to pastries and sugary treats, this spot has totally transformed my morning routine.\n\nThe baristas are super friendly, the coffee is rich and perfectly brewed, and the atmosphere is cozy without being pretentious. Their locally roasted beans have this incredible depth of flavor that makes every sip feel like a warm hug. The oatmeal bar is genius - it's healthy, del",
        "Here's the review:\n\nThis review is strictly for purchase of a Christmas tree.\n\nI was pretty set on getting our tree from another store because it was a steal but they had run out and my heart was sad. So me and my family were on a mission to find our perfect Christmas tree, without spending a fortune on doing so.\n\nFor whatever reason, I thought I was going to be stuck shopping at a Christmas tree lot to get our tree. It never crossed my mind to come to a Nursery to get a Christmas tree, but when we arrived, I was pleasantly surprised! The selection was incredible - fresh, beautifully shaped trees in all sizes. The staff was super helpful, guiding us to the perfect Noble Fir that fit our living room perfectly. Prices were reasonable, and they even helped us load the tree. The tree is still looking fresh a week later, and the kids are thrilled. I'm officially a convert to buying Christmas",
        "Here's the review:\n\nI usually try to write only positive reviews of places or companies, but lately I've come across one too many bad doctors in this valley and fed up, felt compelled to describe my experience here at PHG. Unfortunately, it differs greatly then that of most of the other reviews. It is those other reviews that convinced me to try this place. I guess not everything works for everyone, but I wanted to share my personal experience.\n\nCompletely unimpressed with this place and Dr. Majidi. From the dingy exterior of the building to the outdated waiting room and seemingly disinterested staff, everything felt unprofessional. The wait time was excessive - over an hour past my scheduled appointment - and when I finally saw the doctor, he seemed rushed and barely listened to my concerns. His diagnosis felt generic and his bedside manner was cold and dismissive. The follow-up care was equally disappointing, with unclear instructions and minimal communication",
        "Here's the review:\n\nThis store automatically gets only one star because the worst sales associate I have ever come across has transferred from the CL store at the Palazzo to this one. I don't know her name but she's a tall, older lady with short dark hair and a European accent who has a scowl on her face at all times. She's not knowledgeable, helpful, or friendly at all and makes me feel extremely uncomfortable. Who wants to get the death stare while they are shopping or even shopping at ANOTHER store right across the way (which she has done to me)? Her attitude is completely unprofessional and ruins the entire shopping experience. I've worked in retail, and I know how important customer service is, but this woman seems to have missed that memo entirely. Management needs to address her behavior because she is driving potential customers away. I would rather shop online or at a different location than deal with her intimidating and unwel",
        "Unusual for a Vietnamese restaurant, I hold this place to the same standard of cleanliness I expect from a Chinese restaurant: if it tastes good and doesn't make me sick, it's a-okay! I have grown up in Asian restaurants and really, despite all the negative reviews, this place isn't that scary! If you're looking for ambiance, well, maybe you should save this one for another day. I can't say I've ever been to a Vietnamese restaurant where the decorations blew me away. However, if you are craving some mighty decent Vietnamese cuisine, you won't be disappointed here. The pho is rich and flavorful, with tender meat and perfectly cooked noodles that transport you straight to Hanoi. Their banh mi is generously stuffed and has that perfect balance of crispy bread and savory fillings. The staff, while not overly friendly, are efficient and know their menu well. Prices",
        "Here's the review:\n\nfor everyone who says this place is amazing, they must be blind to true culinary technique. ok so first thing I noticed was the drab wait staff. very boring and didn't even sound excited to be at work. on another note, the menu is written well but the food did not deliver. i wanted to try the fried deviled eggs, and they were clearly warmed up in the microwave and dry. the homemade spicy aioli, was nothing more than sriracha and mayo. i understand what aioli, but is wasn't mixed well or something. then, my main course arrived - a supposedly signature braised short rib that looked like it had been sitting under heat lamps for hours. the meat was tough, stringy, and completely lacking any depth of flavor. the accompanying roasted vegetables were equally disappointing - bland, overcooked, and seemingly forgotten on the plate. the entire dining experience felt like",
        "March of last year, the BF and I were in the midst of a cross country move - all the way from Chapel Hill, NC to LA. The BF was especially sad as he was leaving his NC climbing crew of 7 years behind. So what better way to get together with some of his climbing friends who had also moved out west of the Mississippi? Meet up at the Red Rock Rendezvous!\n\nA weekend of climbing clinics, swag, and events sponsored by Mountain Gear to raise cash for the Access Fund... we quickly realized it was 80% socializing and 20% actual climbing. But honestly? That was perfect. The atmosphere was electric, with climbers from all over sharing stories, tips, and plenty of laughs. The clinics were well-organized, and the gear demos were a blast. While we didn't spend every moment on the rock, the networking and community vibes more than made up for it. It",
        "I am shocked that I am barely writing this review for Wildflower Bread Company since I eat here at least twice a week. I used to be obsessed with Paradise Bakery but then I met Wildflower and so I dumped them. The reason? Their ingredients! So fresh, so delicious! I've literally had everything on their menu and there is nothing that I wouldn't recommend. Isn't that hard to admit when it's not your mom's food you are having? Well anyways, another thing I love about Wildflower is that they are always giving back to the community. A few months ago, I witnessed them donating unsold bread to local shelters and supporting local farmers. Their commitment to quality extends beyond just serving great food. The staff is always friendly, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the portions are generous. Whether I'm grabbing a quick sandwich for lunch or enjoying a leisurely breakfast, Wil",
        "Here's the review:\n\nI have never had Dim Sum until this weekend....it was a totally new experience for me. I met up w/ some friends in Vegas (who lived there) because I was in town (to PARTY)! They invited me to Changs to lunch where I had met them. They explained to me how it worked but they did all the ordering because I would probably order some weird stuff. Now I dont know the names of any of the stuff I ate..so im going to try and describe it was best as I can....\n\nWe had these amazing little steamed dumplings that were like little pillows of joy! Some were filled with what I think was shrimp, and others seemed to have pork. The texture was incredible - soft on the outside and packed with flavor inside. My friends also ordered these crispy rolls that were golden brown and absolutely delicious. The service was super friendly, and the restaurant had this bust",
        "Here's the review:\n\nI would consider myself a Whole Foods Market super fan from Michigan to North Carolina to Arizona. They are generally where I find foods I love. It's where I do most of my \"healthy\" shopping. I usually will only shop at other stores when I can't find what I need at a Whole Foods.\n\nHits:\nNice selection of bulk dry items. Veggos and fruits are the best. I stock up on the spices for cooking. The store and baskets are clean.\n\nThe Chandler location is a gem for health-conscious shoppers like myself. The store layout is intuitive, and the staff is always helpful and friendly. Prices can be a bit high, but you're paying for quality organic and locally sourced products. Their prepared foods section is impressive, with plenty of ready-to-eat options for busy professionals. The produce is consistently fresh, and I love how they clearly label local an",
        "Here's the review:\n\nI'm not one to overindulge, but when I am desirous for an adult beverage, I want the best. It was a gift for a colleague that led me back to the spirits purveyor, that until now, was always a pleasure to visit.\n\nFar from expert in my knowledge of Canadian whiskey, I was hoping an experienced staff member of this shop might help me select the best. Unfortunately, the feeling I got was akin to interrupting a brain surgeon at work--although this one was operating on cardboard with a box cutter. Brusque doesn't begin to describe the customer service. The employee seemed more interested in restocking shelves than providing any meaningful guidance.\n\nThe selection appeared decent, but without knowledgeable assistance, I felt completely lost. What could have been an engaging shopping experience turned into an awkward and frustrating encounter. I'll likely seek out a more welcoming liqu",
        "I read some blog about a guy going off as to how great this place was. So my wife and I drove to Brossard to check it out.\n\nThe restaurant is laid out very unusually, its half a bar, pizza place and the other half is the breakfast side. When you first arrive we thought we entered the wrong place, because it was a pizza joint with no server present. Once we walked through the pizza place we entered the side of the breakfast place where some random waiter said \"ya just sit anywhere\". The food was so-so, with bland pancakes that tasted like they were made from a premix and eggs that were slightly overcooked. The coffee was lukewarm and seemed like it had been sitting out for a while. Service was incredibly casual, bordering on indifferent. While the concept of combining a pizza place and breakfast spot sounds interesting, the execution falls short. I wouldn't go out of my way to return,",
        "Here's the review:\n\nOne of the few places that was open for Christmas and what an unexpected present! My bar manager at Fez used to manage for this restaurant and suggested we all go in a group. Now, pulling into this place it looked like it would be some hole in the wall restaurant. It was all black on the outside, so you couldn't see in and it was in a strip mall!! But let me tell ya, when you walk in there is an immediate change of heart as soon as you see the fountain waterfall in front of you.\n\nThe interior is stunning, with elegant decor and a warm, inviting atmosphere. The menu offers an impressive selection of dishes that are expertly prepared and beautifully presented. I ordered the seafood risotto, which was creamy, perfectly seasoned, and packed with fresh seafood. The service was exceptional - attentive without being intrusive. Prices are slightly higher than average, but the",
        "Here's the review based on your input:\n\nThe food was fresh, well prepared and delicious. The service was friendly and attentive. Not a fan of the ambiance, but I'm not there to eat the decor.\n\nI went on a Saturday night around 6pm and it was busy but not packed. The samosas were a highlight - freshly made, crispy on the outside and tender inside with a little spice that gave them a nice kick. The szechuan chicken was equally impressive, with perfectly fried chicken pieces mixed with onions, green peppers, and hot peppers that maintained a great balance of crispiness and tenderness.\n\nWhile the restaurant's interior might not win any design awards, the culinary experience more than makes up for it. The portions were generous, and the flavors were authentic and vibrant. Prices were reasonable, and the staff was attentive without being intrusive. I'd definitely recommen",
        "Here's the review:\n\nThe first time I came here, I recognized the lady working the counter was the lady who worked at Jenni Pho. I can't comment on the pho as my favorite dish is the dried vermicelli salad. I also ordered their 3-bean dessert. It was a good first experience which deemed for a second trip.\n\nMy second visit was not as good. Because It was a work day, I decided to use the drive through, however when I got to the drive through there was a sign that said \"come inside to see the menu.\" This was incredibly frustrating. I was already running late for work and didn't have time to park and go inside. The lack of a visible drive-through menu and clear communication was a major disappointment. While my first visit was pleasant, this experience made me hesitant to return. Customer convenience is key, and this restaurant seems to miss the mark on that front.",
        "Here's the review:\n\nI used to love coming to Mimi's when I would be in town visiting family. It used to be crowded and we'd have to rush to beat the line. Sadly those times are done....I will not be back!\n\nWhen we got there at 6pm the place was empty. Score!?! No, its empty because it has majority gone down hill. We had 4 people and split 2 dinner for 2s and we got the baked brie also. Regarding our 5 appetizers: baked brie bleh (better not melted and not enough bread), house salad was bland and overdressed, calamari was rubbery, and the crab cakes were more breading than actual crab. The main courses weren't much better - dry chicken and overcooked fish that tasted like it had been sitting under heat lamps for hours. The service",
        "Here's the review:\n\nI went here with the high hopes that it will be my new favorite place since there are great positive reviews about it.. sadly, my hopes were all shattered :(\n\nService: if I could give a negative star, I would.. we were seated right away at the bar.. but then, it has been 10 minutes at least, and no one had taken the initiative to give us a menu or offer a drink.. my boyfriend end up getting a menu himself up front. After that, still nothing. So I asked the chef on the bar (I think he's the owner) about getting service, and he seemed annoyed.\n\nThe food wasn't much better. Our appetizers arrived lukewarm, and the main course was completely underwhelming. The presentation looked promising, but the flavors were flat and uninspired. Prices were high for the quality we received. The entire experience felt disconnected and unprofessional.",
        "Here's the review:\n\nThis place is a F N joke!!!\n\nI took my car to the Henderson shop to get a oil change and on my car there is a plastic cover on the bottom that you have to take off to get to the oil filter. The lazy mechanic took it of and never put it back. And i just changed my air filter and they tell me it needs to be replaced WTF. They say they put A synthetic blend oil Yeah right.\n\nDO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR THERE!!!!\n\nI should have known I will never again take my car to this absolute disaster of a service center. The staff is unprofessional, careless, and seemingly more interested in charging you for unnecessary repairs than providing quality work. Their lack of attention to detail is shocking - leaving off critical protective covers could potentially cause serious damage to my vehicle. The entire experience was frustrating, and I felt completely disrespected as a customer. Save yourself the",
        "I ate here last week. I initially enjoyed the ambiance, the nice wait staff, and the wide selection of sushi, robata, and cocktails. However, our food and drinks were littered with inedible garnishes. One of our drinks contained inedible wood sticks and leaves, while the plate came with a side of hollowed out crustacean appendages.\n\nWhile I understand that the harvested tree parts add to the flavor of the drink, the crustacean carcases added nothing to the plate other than to disgust their customers. It was a clear attempt at pretentious presentation that missed the mark entirely. The sushi, while potentially tasty, was overshadowed by the bizarre and unappetizing decorative choices. The cocktails, though creatively conceived, were more about shock value than actual enjoyment. The staff, while friendly, seemed oblivious to the culinary missteps. Overall,",
        "Here's the review:\n\nI had mentioned to my boyfriend that I needed to renew my eyeglass prescription, and he mentioned the deal America's best had where you can get an eye exam and 2 pairs of glasses including the lenses for $69.99. I needed contacts as well and when I called the store, I specifically asked if there was a way to get both the eyeglass and contact lens exam for an additional cost. The woman on the phone told me for $79.99 I could have both the eyeglass exam and contact lens exam, so just $10 more.\n\nWhen I arrived at the store, the experience was mixed. The optometrist was professional and thorough, taking time to explain my vision needs. However, the waiting area was crowded and the process felt a bit rushed. The glasses selection was decent for the price point, with several stylish frames to choose from. The contacts fitting went smoothly,",
        "We dined here this evening with my daughter's dance studio being located in the same plaza. We were both super excited to get a Greek place nearby and had waited anxiously since we saw the signage up prior to opening. It was pretty disappointing, I am sad to say :(\n\nThe initial experience was frustrating, with a long wait at the counter and an even longer wait for our food. While the complimentary soup samples were a nice gesture, the 40-minute wait for two simple plates was excessive. The gyro and souvlaki were ultimately just average - nothing special that would make me want to return. The staff seemed disorganized, and the one owner who helped us appeared overwhelmed. Prices were slightly higher than comparable Greek restaurants in the area, which made the mediocre meal feel even less satisfying. The restaurant has potential, but they need to work on their efficiency, food quality, and overall customer service. For now,",
        "Here's the review:\n\nI was in Las Vegas a couple of weeks ago for work. On Friday night we went out for a group dinner at Enoteca. I have never been to this establishment but having been to Carnevino and having a WONDERFUL dinner I had expectations.\n\nEnoteca is a bit more casual and low key than Carne and offers pastas, pizzas and a small variety of entrees. Our group started with a selection of cheeses, Prosciutto di Parma and fried squash blossoms. Not being a huge squash fan, I was surprised by how delightful the blossoms were - crispy, light, and perfectly seasoned. The Prosciutto was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the cheese plate was expertly curated with a nice variety of textures and flavors.\n\nFor my main course, I opted for the handmade",
        "Here's a review based on the provided text:\n\nOWNERS - STAY AWAY FROM THEM!!!!!!!!!\n\nRead the other reviews. They are all true. This company could care less about you and your tenants. I will not even go into my long long list of problems because they have an excuse to justify everything that they do to people. Look at how much time the owner spends responding to complaints on this site. He does not know how to say \"I am sorry, I did not service your account correctly, let me fix it\". Instead he puts 100% of his effort into laying blame at everyone else's feet and deflecting responsibility.\n\nMy experience with this property management company has been nothing short of a nightmare. From unresolved maintenance issues to poor communication, they consistently demonstrate a complete lack of professionalism. Their customer service is abysmal, and they seem more interested in making excuses than actually solving problems. Save yourself the headache",
        "Shocker folks, I don't normally like hot dogs. The only way you can hand me a hot dog I'll actually eat is if it's fresh off the grill. With loads of ketchup...and I DO mean loads, like buckets full! If I ever think of eating a hot dog without ketchup, the world may end. The world kinda did tonight...a little.\n\nI ordered the New York Dog and the Sweetbread Dog, plus the duck fat fries to split with my friend. I had to order the NYC Dog because I love me some classic flavor, and let me tell you, it did NOT disappoint! The Sweetbread Dog was an adventurous choice that surprisingly worked. The buns were perfectly toasted, and the toppings were generously applied. Those duck fat fries? Pure heaven - crispy, golden, and packed with flavor. The staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was",
        "Here's the review:\n\nIf I could post zero stars, that's what I would do. Let me preface this with the fact that we got here at 7pm on a Saturday...busy time for sure, but a restaurant should be able to forecast for that. After placing our orders, our waiter let's me know that I got the last order of brisket available (again, it's only 7pm on a Saturday). Next, our food comes and here's where the real fun starts. My Mom's pulled pork looks chopped (as opposed to actually pulled) and it's DRY AS sandpaper. My brisket, which I was supposedly \"lucky\" to get, was more like shoe leather - tough, flavorless, and completely disappointing. The sides were equally underwhelming: lukewarm mac and cheese and coleslaw that tasted like it had been sitting out for hours. Service was slow, in"
