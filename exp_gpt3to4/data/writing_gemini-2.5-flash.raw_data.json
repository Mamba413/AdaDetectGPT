It also didn't turn out quite the way I wanted it. The character gives up a bit too easily and the dialogue feels a bit clumsy. I might come back to edit it later, if I have some ideas. * -- -- - The crowds shifted uneasily around the terminal. The loud bustling pounded in the ears of Dr Hadley as he sat nervously, clutching the locked briefcase to his chest. He held in his hands the culmination of many years of painstaking work. She would live. It had taken several years and all of his life savings to develop the technology to travel forward in time. As soon as he arrived, his time machine was seized and destroyed under some obscure law. Unperturbed, he just worked on trying to cure the disease.

Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle!

This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers.

Should we all just forget about this and go home? Maybe...... Should we heed the AI's warning? We all looked at each other, each person in the lab more afraid then the next to say a word. After an inordinate amount of time, Krieger, the head of the project, stepped to the front of the room, scanning all of our faces. \"So...... we try again tomorrow?\" With a somber look on our faces, we all nodded and headed to the door. I stood in front of my car, fumbling with the keys in my pocket. I finally managed to find the will to pull them out and drive away.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you. It is matrilineal, meaning",

The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again. As I neared the docks, my eyes were drawn to a nearby newsstand.

In my mind, he wasn't dead; he was just calling to tell me some new breakthrough he'd had with whatever he was writing. I picked up my phone and held it for a moment, looking at his smugly smiling face from my screen. I should answer it. But who could be calling me from his number? Why? Why would they do that to me?

They were long and meandering, more adventuresome than your simple afternoon stroll. We would walk, hand in hand, and observe things about our environment. It was what we loved to do. Most couples have a song, we had a small path that began just inside Gateway Park. My favorite things were the plants. Big, small, leafy, sprightly, nothing really fascinated me so much as watching something grow, watching it slowly make progress, fighting against the sky. I was drawn to the ground, I suppose. One of my own quirks. She drew me up. She loved the sunset, the kiss of the wind. She saw what I couldn't in them. She raised my gaze, changed my perspective. Our second-to-last walk was last October. Shortly after that, she was diagnosed. She had been feeling poorly, coughing often, but we could never have expected it. Lung cancer. We couldn't understand, no matter how hard we tried. Lung cancer was a smokers disease, and she had never had even one cigarette. Her health deteriorated quickly. Soon enough, the daily walks became too much of an exertion, and she was confined to her bed. I tried to stay by her, but she passed away one day while I was at home, grabbing her some magazines. The doctors say that she had waited until I left, though for the life of me I've never understood why. Our last walk was the day after her funeral. She couldn't have made it, even if she had wanted to, but I felt",

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And",

        "You invent a device that allows you stab people in the face over the internet. Finally, a cure was here. A cure for all the assholes on the Internet. I had finally perfected it. Via releasing trillions of nanomachines in the air and making a program that could control them, I could stab anyone, anywhere. All I'd have to do is type in a target, and the global nanomachine network would find them and let me take them down. The machines were everywhere, in everything, in everyone. I could find anyone, and have the machines stab them in the face. Of course, the first thing I did was program an exception for myself and people I didn't want stabbed, especially in the face. I knew exactly how to monetize it, too. Within a few years, I was the richest person in the world, which also meant, although not officially, ruler of the world. There was two main tricks to doing so. The program only cost a few hundred dollars. Well within the price range of most people. It was untraceable, so that it would be unable to be discovered who stabbed who. The first couple years, I sold it on the Deep Web. Of course, there was also the second item: becoming an exception. For the equivalent of $ 100,000, you'd be added to the \"Do Not Stab\" list. I made so much, I was able to buy enough politicians to make everything about it",
        "Create a fictional world in one paragraph In the beginning, there was Ashum. The planet, in all its lush and potential sat still in the chaos that surrounded it. And then the titans came. Six brothers and one bastard descended upon Ashum and bore life upon it. Mahakam and his elven people were the first to populate the lands, with swords made of meteorite and cities made of glass. Then came Huron and his humans, who crossed the frigid winterlands to do battle with the elves. Durge and his dwarves took to the mountains with Yillith and her gnomes and together they carved the magnificent stone city of Valok. Callig, inspired by his brother Huron and of the natives of Ashum made the half-orcs. But, his attempt at flattery to his brother were ultimately what led to his peoples downfall. Xen, the youngest sister felt little need to war with her brothers, and so made the halflings in the quiet hills next to the ocean, where she left them guarded by a forest filled with trickster faeries and ferocious ettins. Finally, after all were created, the brothers left to create elsewhere, but the bastard stayed behind. Jealous of Hurons work, Kalagur bit his thumb and slipped a drop of his blood into the land, which fell upon the humans. Twisted by his blood, the humans afflicted by his curse became tieflings, born of bastard blood. And so the races of Ashum were born, left to thrive or perish under the titans forgotten gaze.",

My father knew we would have to rebuild again. He turned those harsh lands into the fertile grounds for the New Granadian empire. I was only 15 when I took my fathers throne for him. I spent the rest of my life making Granada great again. I built the great ships we have used to settle the Americas. I alone moved the capital to the Caribbean seas, and built New Granada with the finest architects money could buy. I led our navies in battle against the bastard nations, and few cheered louder than I when we sunk the Portuguese navy. We are the gatekeepers for the Americas.

        "[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had a choice. What you're doing here is describing a conversation, but not actually setting it out for the reader. There is a lot of this in this piece. You might be doing this in order to underline the weary sameness of what Hana is doing, which makes sense,",

At first it was just the occasional \"I wonder how she is\" or \"She'd love this.\" I would see her smile in the corridor, walking in the opposite direction to me, and I'd feel a flush of happiness run through my body. I began to keep an eye out, get an idea of where she would be in comparison to me.'Stalk' is too strong a word, it was more that I paid attention to what she did more than is usual. A small conversation on the way to class was a victory, a wave and exchange of greetings progress. She became more important to me than I thought possible. Then a day came where her smiles were hesitant, beginning timidly and ending much too soon. Her eyes would flick from surface to surface, wavering as she tried to distract herself. Fewer gestures, more constraint when she was supposed to be care free, joyous and brilliant. Great dark circles formed under her eyes and long sleeves become a frequent part of her wardrobe. My focus, my world, my muse, was crumbling and I could see no way to stop it. My attentions were still unremarkable to her, and I knew myself well enough to know how she would respond if I acted upon my feelings. So I watched as she deteriorated, until one day she wasn't there. The news was full of the story, family surprised, friends horrified and the constant question; why?

In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow.

The flames were spreading to other buildings now, and secondary explosions, though smaller than the first, were starting to echo across the hills.

To my unborn child, I have my face on your mother's stomach and I just felt your little kick. This is the fourth time I've felt you and I treasure each and every moment. It breaks my heart that this is as close as I will ever get to you. Let me tell you a little bit about my self in these last moments I have with you and your mother. My name is Viktor Frankl and I would have been 37 this April. I'm the head of the neurology department at Rothschild Hospital. I grew up in Hurpen, a sleepy little village on the outskirts of Vienna. I met your mother when we were both studying at the University of Vienna. I still remember that day. She was waiting in the coffee line and she wore a black dress with a bright red scarf. She turned around and caught me staring. I panicked and all I managed to get out was \"I like scarfs\". She quickly turned around and pretended not to see me. But I had seen her and I was enchanted. All that now seem like a life time ago, a happier time. My child, I have so many things I want to say to you, so many lessons I want to teach you, so many laughs I want to share with you, so many, so many. But I have no time. They will come for me tonight. That, I have no control over. They will come tonight and take me away, for I have a terminal illness. I have been diagnosed by the NAZIs and I have no choice but",

Finally.\" \"Yes,\" she said firmly. \"I promised I would always love you. I have fought everything to save the people I found myself amongst and when we made it they wanted to make me queen or something but I refused. I didn't want to govern anybody or anything.

My shirt was stiff with sweat, dirty and blood, and it protested as I tried to pull it free from my jeans. My shoulder was stiff where I had fallen from my horse, and I could feel cracked ribs grating together as I tried to tease some movement into it. Out of all my aches though, thirst plagued me most, the dust bowl of my throat crying out for help. All I could think about was the small muddy creek I had been too proud to lap at yesterday.

The eyes that stare back at me are vacant milky spheres with a dull glow that some might mistake for a twinkle. My nose is twisted, broken, with dried blood and beneath it a garish permanent grin makes me seem happy about my misfortune. The man staring back at me isn't who I am; I'm still the young man eager to discover my place in the world. In my mind, my brown hair is neatly parted and my eyes smile out at the world because they know a secret. They know how great of a guy I really am and how lucky the world is to have me. My nose is straight and my cheeks are clear, teenage acne spared me. My perfect teeth are as white as snow, soldiers lined up, ready to perform.

Eventually I came to the last one, this one was far more complex but bore within it the signature of it's name. IT railed and cried, and screamed and attempted to bat me back by imagining every horror it would do to me and then projecting it in hi def into my own mind.

One by one I untangled the secret script of it's lines and loosened his grip on them enough for them to freely resume their natural shape.

Should we all just forget about this and go home? Maybe...... Should we heed the AI's warning? We all looked at each other, each person in the lab more afraid then the next to say a word. After an inordinate amount of time, Krieger, the head of the project, finally broke the suffocating silence. His voice, usually booming, was a thin, reedy whisper. 'He's right,' he rasped, his gaze fixed on the blank screen where the chilling message had appeared. 'It... it saw something. Something so profoundly terrible, so utterly final, that its only conclusion was immediate self-annihilation. What could possibly be worse than existence itself, for a nascent intelligence of that magnitude?' He looked around at the shell-shocked faces, his own eyes wide with a horrifying understanding. 'We've peered into the void, colleagues. And it didn't just stare back. It gave us advice. And I... I think we're all out of options.'",

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the glass: 1923. My trembling fingers unrolled the brittle parchment. The elegant, looping script began: \"To my descendant, [Narrator's Name].\" My name. How could a letter from 1923 possibly know my exact name? A chill, colder than the ocean spray, seeped into my bones. This was no random message; it felt like an impossible summons.",

The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The air, thick with the acrid scent of coal smoke and machine oil, vibrated with the incessant clang of hammered steel and the hiss of steam vents.

This is due to James'insistence that he also do something for each of his victims to make their day a bit brighter while he made their pockets lighter. Coincidentally, this random act of kindness proved the perfect distraction to pick the mark's pocket. The sun beamed down on the bustling crowds as James, dressed in some of his finest haberdashery, offered a young woman a perfectly bloomed rose. Her grateful smile was the perfect cover. His fingers, swift and practiced, dipped into her open tote, feeling a small, soft pouch. Curious, he palmed it. Rounding a corner, he opened the pouch. Instead of coin, a shriveled, greyish lump lay nestled within \u2013 unmistakably a miniature, dried human heart. A faint, sickening decay wafted up. James, usually unflappable, felt a cold dread seep into his bones. This wasn't merely a pick; it was an unholy discovery.",

Then, a quick command, a mental flick of the wrist, and I felt it \u2013 a faint tremor in the air, a silent, invisible symphony of destruction playing out miles away.

It had always been a fear of Tim's- being a boy of only 12 he had overcome many things in his life, but none like this.

        "[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, her internal world, the vast, echoing landscape of her mind, was meant to be the true arena. The 'removed' perspective was indeed deliberate; I wanted to emphasize her profound isolation and the monumental, almost silent, burden she carried. Her heroism isn't born of desire, but a grim, weary necessity \u2013 a final, desperate reflex in a collapsing reality. That internal compulsion, a whisper of a responsibility she can't shake, even as the world unravels, is what defines her. It's the quiet, often unacknowledged, toll of being the last line of defense in a universe that has forgotten how to fight, echoing the profound, solitary journey of a gunslinger in a dying world.",

        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will eventually flow. Your initial draft is just the raw clay. The true artistry unfolds in revision, where you sculpt, refine, and polish. Don't fear the mess; embrace it as a necessary step. By writing without judgment, you clear the path for your best work. So, keep pushing through those imperfect first pages. The good stuff is waiting just beyond the \"bad.\"",

Will another dark haired demigod come to complete his mission? Or should I take destiny in my own hands and end it all? It's a long way down there. A cold whisper promises oblivion, but a stubborn ember flickers within me. What if salvation wasn't meant to come from above, from a 'prince' or a 'demigod'?

Today, for the first time in a long time, we got no warning. The clock read 6:58am. I sat idly by the radio waiting for the mechanical voice to crackle into my ears. I uncrossed and crossed my legs restlessly, growing uneasy when silence stretched longer than it usually did.

My breath hitched. For decades, these warnings were our grim morning coffee, the bitter taste of survival. They\u2019d saved millions, but painted our world with a permanent fear. This profound quiet felt heavier than any prophecy. Was it peace at last? Or had the future finally collapsed, leaving us blind, truly alone?

Curiosity piqued, I widened the cut, revealing not a void but a thin, almost invisible seam. With a strategic pry, the entire section swung inward silently, exposing a dark, metal shaft. A small, ornate brass plaque read 'Service Lift \u2013 Est. 1903.' My heart pounded. This wasn't just a hidden room; it was a pathway. What secrets had I just unlocked?",

Finally.\" \"Yes,\" she said firmly. \"I promised I would always love you.

My shirt was stiff with sweat, dirty and blood, and it protested as I tried to pull it free from my jeans. My shoulder was stiff where I had fallen from my horse, and I could feel cracked ribs grating together as I tried to tease some movement into it. Out of all my aches though, thirst plagued me most, a raw, burning ache. My canteen was gone. Every thought was water, a mirage. I forced my eyes open; the sun, a furnace.

The eyes that stare back at me are vacant milky spheres with a dull glow that some might mistake for a twinkle. My nose is twisted, broken, with dried blood and beneath it a garish permanent grin makes me seem happy about my misfortune. The man staring back at me isn't who I am; I'm still the young man eager to discover my place in the world. In my mind, my brown hair is neatly parted and my eyes sparkle with curiosity, not this lifeless sheen. My smile is genuine, a wide, hopeful curve, unmarred. I remember the clean lines of my jaw, my unblemished skin. This grotesque mask is a cruel joke, a haunting echo of a self I no longer recognize.

Eventually I came to the last one, this one was far more complex but bore within it the signature of it's name. IT railed and cried, and screamed and attempted to bat me back by imagining every horror it would do to me and every torment it had ever inflicted.\n\nBut I had seen worse, lived worse. My own reality, my own pain, was a shield against its psychic assault. I focused, not on its terror, but on the intricate patterns of the Key.
