        "We had dinner here last night. It was our second time eating at Moishes, and the place had been remodeled since the last time we were there about a decade ago. It looks like the inside of a casino. Wall-to-wall carpet, glass chandeliers, wood paneling. The tables are packed in, and the place was full to the gills on Friday night. It was fairly raucous. The ambiance is not unpleasant; it's just very lively. Perfect for people watching. \\n\\nThey seat you and bring bread, good coleslaw and pickles right away, which is nice. We ordered the shrimp cocktail, a ribeye and a porterhouse, fries, a Montecarlo potato and mushrooms. The sides were tasty. The steaks were not. Good quality meat, but it was bland, under spiced, grey on the outside instead of charbroiled. Weirdly enough, Moishes actually sells a brand of steak spice,",
        "Hmmmm - not sure how this place has won awards or was so busy the night we went. \\n\\nWe were greeted promptly and seated right away, always a plus. We were greeted by two different waiters - not a big deal as they were busy. BUT when our waiter came up to the table (and it's really loud so it was hard to hear him) we weren't ready to order drinks yet, and after greeting us he just walked away. Again, it was loud so I'm not sure if he said anything but it didn't look like it.\\n\\nWhen he came back, we ordered drinks and asked about appetizers. He recommended the lollipops and was forthcoming with offering suggestions, which again was good.\\n\\nThe lollipops were minced up chicken meat rolled up and fried - extremely strange. They menu made it sound like they were more like skewers or chicken wings, not minced chicken meatballs. And the taste was off too, just a",
        "Cox has super lousy customer service. From the phone reps to the techs to the supervisors. My appointment today (which was a bogus problem on their end, not mine) was for a 3 -5 pm window. So I worked to fit this time into my schedule and bargained with coworkers to get out of work early. 5:45 comes and nobody shows...So I call Cox. It is now 6:45 and I am still waiting for somebody to take me off hold. Meanwhile I am \\\"\"live-chatting\\\"\" with a rep named Maritza R. who cannot tell me if the tech will be arriving and tells me that if they aren't there in the window they wont come. I told her that her customer service is lousy and I would like a manager. She promptly ends the chat. So I start a new chat. I get a fellow named Federico and immediately ask for a manager without disclosing any of the previous information. Funny thing is that after a",
        "This was probably one of the most disappointing massages I've had in my life. \\n\\nThe location doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside is pretty nice. The massage tables are heated and really comfortable. \\n\\nMy friend and I made reservations for 50 minute massages, but decided when we got there that we wanted an 80 minute one. The receptionist said that they couldn't accommodate us, which is understandable. But when we were done there was no one waiting to go next and it seemed like more than 2 masseuses were free.\\n\\nI chose the combination of deep tissue and Swedish massage. The masseuse said she would apply the deep tissue massage for the areas that needed it. I specifically mentioned that I had a huge knot in my lower back, yet the therapist spent less than 5 minutes on it initially, and only worked on it after I asked how much time was remaining near the end of the massage. After she started working on it she told me that it",

The last movie I saw here was the first Matrix movie... and I don't think much has been updated in the past 13+ years since then.\\n\\nSwung by to see Rush (by Ron Howard); it was a Sunday at 6:20pm - the parking lot was nearly empty. The ticket sales person was friendly; she made a little small talk and said that she heard Rush was a great film - apparently she was going to try to watch it tomorrow. I appreciated the chat; all too often stores/shops/etc are staffed with drones. Not the case here.\\n\\nFigured I'd treat myself to a small popcorn and a soda. Concession stand had zero people in line; another very friendly staff member asked if she could get me anything. I placed my order and she did something that made me want to rate this place at 5 stars: she said, \\\"\"I'll fill your popcorn half-way, and if you'd like me to add butter or salt, you'll get a better mix.\\\"\" I declined the butter but did shake a little salt into the middle of the",

Introductions were in order we sat down and at this point I just wanted to take a look at the gym to see what was available. Griffin was not having it! He ignored my request and wanted to continue with my goals. Told him I just wanted to do cardio and to lose weight. I asked to see the gym before we discussed prices so I have a better idea what I was looking at. Griffin was not having it. \\\"\"I want to get to know you\\\"\" I asked\\\"\" Can you get to know me after the tour?\\\"\" Griffin was not having it. I told him you are not listening to your guest or your customer. He did not care and still wanted to continue with his scripted speech and still wanted to still get to know me. It was not until I stood up",
        "I had my son's birthday party at the waterpark in the hotel. They advertise this service, and even offer coupons from time to time. I was not very happy with the whole process from start to finish. There are too many ridiculous rules. For one thing, I think it's good business to honor coupons that are presented, whether or not they are expired--the purpose is to attract business, right? Then we need to bring in our own cake, which is fine, but you can't say we NEED to bring one type of food item, and then BAN other food items. I brought some chips and crackers to the party room. Then I was told (after I already set everything up) that we couldn't have snacks in the party room. Or drinks. Would YOU like to attend a party with no snacks or drinks? So then I got to trudge back and forth to the room, moving food and carrying",

I always get the spicy chicken dish and await the fun. \\n\\nTo those who don't know (I didn't before I went here!), Ethiopian food doesn't come with utensils, instead it's plated on this spongy bread which you break off and use to pick up the food. It's amazing and like I mentioned above, a great place to take a date.",

The food is not the same and not in a good way, I just had the lunch special with the $2 upcharge for shrimp instead of chicken. The shrimp is undercooked, lower grade and on 4 little ones for the extra $2. I guess it breaks down to 50 cent per shirmp that isn't even close to as good as it was. The Pad Thai Noodles are all clumped together and you can't use the cheap flimsy plastic fork to even get through it. The noodles are dark brown and full of what taste like GARLIC! I just ordered it and picked it up, how does it taste like yesterday's leftovers? Who is back there now in the kitchen? it can't be the same cook, just awful.\\nI don't know what is going on here, it's like the same old game again Good food and well prepared",

I was hopeful after calling them up and asking them if their recipes were different from Royal Thai. Royal Thai also had pretty lame curry, so I was excited to give Weera a try.\\n\\nI ordered the duck curry. It was listed on a sign outside as a \\\"\"special\\\"\" dish. It looked nice and red and yummy on the sign. When I got my duck curry, the look alone had me concerned. It was a light custardy color. The taste... bland as hell. I've never had such a bland curry before. Yeah, the waitress forgot to ask me what spice level I wanted, but this was just ridiculous. \\n\\nThe other ingredients weren't bad, although they added little cherry tomatoes to try and boost the flavorless curry. The duck was ok, and the veggies were fresh. This fact didn't help me enjoy my curry though, unfortunately.\\n\\nThe first time the waitress asked me if everything was ok, I",

I have traveled all over and stayed at many different hotels from 2 stars to 5 stars and this takes the cake on one of the worst. \\n\\nNot only did I find a COCKROACH on the first day on the night stand next to where we sleep at night..!!!!!! Which alone is horrible and appalling, but the tub was completely disgusting with hair left from previous hotel guests and other particles. I can't express how important cleanliness is to me when staying away from home. After I PERSONALLY cleaned the tub to relax before a night out I turned on the jets and two jets FELL right out of the tub!

There were not only room charges but also other charges like ball room, meeting equipment, beverage, and so on. While believing we have paid for everything, today 6/6 I received this collection call from a collection agent. His name is Nelson. He said that it is reported to credit agency that $72.00 was unpaid. All the 16 rooms and all the expenses, thousands of dollars were paid, and $72.00 was unpaid???\\nI paid for it. Then I called in to the billing department trying to figure out how the mistake happened and trying to find a way to remove it from my record.

When I walked in, the lady immediately told me that they close at 2:30 and handed me a menu as if I should order takeout. I asked, \\\"\"Can I eat here?\\\"\" and she said I could. I sat down, looked at the menu for maybe 1 minute, and she came by and wanted to take my drink and food order at the same time.

I should have gotten up and left figuring I was not going to have a relaxed lunch, but I did not. \\n\\nThe dish I ordered had a star by it, indicating it was spicy but could be modified to customer's taste.

What is the cleanliness in the kitchen? We had the tamales which was dry and the fois gras which was good. The squash was excellent and the spinach salad was excellent but way overdressed. We also had the lobster and basil pasta, the lobster was chewy and the pasta had good flavor but vastly overdressed with oil or butter.

Getting an OEM rim was very important as the OEM rims were forged and the replica was not. I told the bodyshop I would handle the mix up. I went to wheel specialists directly to handle the situation and I dealt with Brad. He was a gigantic asshole. He refused to admit the rim was a replica.

When we arrived at the cars in the parking garage, I was told we would be in a Fiat 500. While I am sure the Fiat would have been fun to drive, it was much too small for our needs.

I really want to give this place 5 stars but there are definitely some areas that need improvement. \\n\\nWhat doesn't need improvement - at least in my opinion - is the food and drink. The food is bar food but it is well-priced and there is a good amount of diversity on the menu. I typically order the baked italian sub, the buffalo chicken wrap, and the turkey bacon wedgie (that's right wedgie). The Pizzas also look great but I have never had one. The draft list is always diverse and I have tried some great new brews here. This is a great place to watch any type of sporting event and they have a pretty decent happy hour as well - although sometimes you have to remind the servers what the specials are. \\n\\nThis brings me to what prevents me from giving this place 5 stars - the service and the atmosphere.

I was hoping to come here twice last week on different lunch dates, but as you were closed, I was unable to. I understand that business is slow when the school year is done and spring term exams are over, however in light of recent events, it has been made clear to me that you do not care about your loyal customers. I wanted to take some friends to Mr. Sushi on August 27, 2014. To make sure that you were open, I walked past your restaurant that day and saw indeed that the hand-drawn sign in your window said that you would be open August 27.

At lunch, my friends and I walked over to Mr. Sushi only to discover that the hand-drawn sign had been changed from August 27 to August 28. We had to go to a restaurant we weren't keen on we did not have much time to eat. It's a shame that you do not care enough to properly inform customers about your hours of business.

The only problem we had was entirely on the food.\\n\\nI like the different tasting dishes but some times it felt really disjointed and confused, as if it lacked something to tie all the small dishes together. \\n\\nThe langoustine tasting was quite fun and interesting. While some of the dishes were amazing, others were like, huh? And the sake shot?

My friends and I are not young, but we were the youngest people there. No problem, it was 8pm and we were starving. We each ordered the prime rib dinner which came with soup, potato and a dessert. The soup was some sort of cream soup that was so gelatinous the spoon stood straight up in the sticky glop, yuck! Thank God the prime rib was brought out quickly, it was FANTASTIC! Medium rare, tender, tasty in it's own juice. Delicious! It's a good thing we weren't hungry for dessert, it was some sort of pudding that had the same gelatinous appearance as the soup earlier.

The burgers weren't great. The meat was gummy and had the feel of biting into some gelatinous gooey meat like substance. Not a burger. The hubs had a super salty veggie burger and my kid had a grilled cheese that was basically a hamburger bun turned inside out and buttered within an inch if it's life and pan fried.

So my wife and I drove to Brossard to check it out.\\n\\nThe restaurant is laid out very unusually, its half a bar, pizza place and the other half is the breakfast side. When you first arrive we thought we entered the wrong place, because it was a pizza joint with no server present. Once we walked through the pizza place we entered the side of the breakfast place where some random waiter said \\\"\"ya just sit anywhere\\\"\". The food was so-so, my poached eggs were undercooked and under whelming, hollandaise sauce tased like it was the \\\"\"just add water\\\"\" stuff. I do give them points for the fresh waffles. The waffles were burnt around the perimeter because they were just cooked fresh in a waffle iron, I would recommend the waffles all day. \\n\\nThe waitress we got I think was sniffing glue or something in the back, not very social and she took our order then",

The woman on the phone told me for $79.99 I could have both the eyeglass exam and contact lens exam, so just $10 more. \\n\\nI made an appointment and saw the doctor as usual, discussed my options for both glasses and contacts and then proceeded to pick out 2 frames to go along with the deal I had called about.

We waited almost 40 minutes for one gyro plate and one souvlaki plate although they did bring out soup samples to all the tables which was very thoughtful. The gyro was nothing to write home about, the meat on the top of the pita was very very crispy, crunchy in fact which oddly enough, added a pleasant texture. The sauce was standard and was just the right amount. The rice was a STANDOUT....super fluffy but in need of a little more seasoning. My husband's souvlaki pita was tasty, the meat was lean, moist",

My Mom's pulled pork looks chopped (as opposed to actually pulled) and it's DRY AS A BONE.

It looks like the inside of a casino. Wall-to-wall carpet, glass chandeliers, wood paneling. The tables are packed in, and the place was full to the gills on Friday night. It was fairly raucous. The ambiance is not unpleasant; it's just very lively. Perfect for people watching.\n\nThey seat you and bring bread, good and warm with butter. We both ordered steaks, cooked to perfection, juicy and flavorful. Sides like creamed spinach were generous and delicious. Despite the bustling crowd, our service was attentive and efficient. Moishes truly delivers a classic steakhouse experience: lively, delicious, and memorable. It's not a quiet dinner spot, but perfect for an energetic night out with fantastic food.",
        "Hmmmm - not sure how this place has won awards or was so busy the night we went. We were greeted promptly and seated right away, always a plus. We were greeted by two different waiters - not a big deal as they were busy. BUT when our waiter came up to the table (and it's really loud so it was hard to hear him) we weren't ready to order drinks yet, and after greeting us he just walked away. Again, it was loud so I'm not sure if he said anything but it didn't look like it. This abrupt departure set a negative tone. We waited another 15 minutes before anyone returned for our drink order, by which point we were ready for food too. The food itself was mediocre \u2013 lukewarm and bland, certainly not justifying the price. Service remained sparse and inattentive throughout. For a highly-rated, busy spot, the experience was a significant letdown. We won't be back.",

It is now 6:45 and I am still waiting for somebody to take me off hold. Meanwhile I am \"live-chatting\" with a rep named Maritza, who informs me there's no record of my technician being dispatched. No apology, just a shrug emoji in text form, essentially. This is beyond frustrating. My entire afternoon was wasted for their incompetence and utter disregard for customer schedules.

The massage tables are heated and really comfortable \u2013 perhaps the only truly positive takeaway from our visit.\n\nMy friend and I made reservations for 50-minute massages, but decided when we got there that we wanted an 80-minute one. The receptionist said that they couldn't accommodate us, which is understandable at face value. However, when we were done, there was no one waiting to go next and it seemed like more than two masseuses were simply chatting in the hallway, indicating ample availability. This made the earlier refusal feel less about scheduling constraints and more about a lack of willingness to be flexible, which was quite frustrating. To top it off, the actual massage itself was mediocre at best, lacking the pressure and focus I needed. Given the unaccommodating service and the underwhelming session, I left feeling more frustrated than relaxed. Definitely won't be returning.",
        "Definitely a theater that's showing its age. The last movie I saw here was the first Matrix movie... and I don't think much has been updated in the past 13+ years since then. Swung by to see Rush (by Ron Howard); it was a Sunday at 6:20pm - the parking lot was nearly empty. The ticket sales person was friendly; she made a little small talk and said that she heard Rush was a great film - apparently she was going to try to watch it tomorrow. I appreciated the chat; all too often, ticket windows feel like transactional turnstiles. The lobby felt stuck in the 90s, complete with faded carpet and an aroma of stale popcorn. Inside the theater, the seats were functional but clearly worn, lacking modern comfort. The screen itself was fine, and the sound for *Rush* was adequate, though not particularly immersive. It served its purpose for a casual Sunday night movie. While not a premium experience, the low crowd density was a plus. If you're looking for an affordable, no-frills screening, this place still delivers, but don't expect any bells or whistles.",

He ignored my request and wanted to continue with my goals. Told him I just wanted to do cardio and to lose weight. I asked to see the gym before we discussed prices so I have a better idea of what I\u2019d be paying for. He completely brushed me off again, insisting we talk numbers first. It felt like a high-pressure sales tactic, not a welcoming introduction to a fitness center. He seemed more interested in closing a deal than genuinely helping me explore my options. We eventually just walked out, utterly disgusted. What a waste of time. Avoid this place if you value your time and want to actually see what you're buying.",

They advertise this service, and even offer coupons, but their policies are just baffling. For starters, I believe it's good business practice to honor coupons, even slightly expired ones, especially when the goal is to attract and retain customers. Refusing a coupon felt incredibly petty and unwelcoming.\n\nThen there's the contradictory food policy. We were told we *needed* to bring our own cake, which is perfectly fine. However, they then strictly banned any other outside food items, even small snacks for the kids. It makes no sense to mandate one type of outside food while prohibiting everything else. The number of ridiculous rules made the whole party feel more like a military operation than a fun celebration. This waterpark needs to re-evaluate its approach to customer service and party planning.",

I guess it breaks down to 50 cents per shrimp that isn't even close to as good as what they used to serve. To make matters worse, the Pad Thai Noodles were all clumped together, and you simply can't use the cheap, flimsy plastic cutlery they provide to even attempt to separate them.

I was hopeful after calling them up and asking them if their recipes were different from Royal Thai. Royal Thai also had pretty lame curry, so I was excited to give Weera a try. I ordered the duck curry. It was listed on a sign outside as a \"special\" dish. It looked nice and red and yummy on the sign. When I got my duck curry, the look alone had me concerned. It was a light custardy orange hue, a far cry from the rich red advertised. The texture was thin and watery, completely lacking the creamy body of a proper curry. Taste-wise, it was bland and strangely sweet, more like a dessert than a savory dish. The duck was acceptable, but it couldn't salvage the uninspired sauce. For a \"special,\" this was a huge letdown. My quest for decent Thai curry continues, as Weera's attempt was a definite miss. Steer clear of their curries.",

I can't express how important cleanliness is to me, and these glaring issues made it impossible to feel comfortable or relax for a single moment. It was utterly disgusting, frankly a health concern, and completely ruined our stay. Having to constantly worry about pests and sanitation is not what you pay for in a hotel, especially in Las Vegas.

While believing we have paid for everything, today 6/6 I received this collection call from a collection agent. His name is Nelson. He said that it is reported to credit agency that $72.00 was unpaid. All the 16 rooms and all the expenses, thousands of dollars were paid, and **now we're dealing with a collection agency for a paltry $72! This is absolutely outrageous. Four months post-event, to have our company's credit potentially impacted over such a minor, likely erroneous charge, after spending thousands, is a testament to their utterly incompetent billing system.

When I walked in, the lady immediately told me that they close at 2:30 and handed me a menu as if I should order takeout. I asked, \"Can I eat here?\" and she said I could. I sat down, looked at the menu for maybe 1 minute, and she came by and wanted to take my order. I felt instantly rushed and unwelcome. It was clear she wanted me out, despite 20 minutes until closing. If they weren't ready for dine-in, they should have just said so, instead of making me feel like an inconvenience. I quickly ordered, ate faster than I ever have, and practically ran out. The food was forgettable, overshadowed by the terrible service. This place clearly prioritizes closing over customer service.

I'm seated and I notice the \"Garage Doors\" Urban Architecture and simple Decor so I like this! It's got Potential! Plenty of Outdoor seating too, Great designs, this place is **definitely aiming for a modern, industrial-chic vibe that works beautifully. The high ceilings and natural light pouring in from those impressive garage doors create an open, airy atmosphere that feels both spacious and inviting. It's not overly fussy, just clean lines and thoughtful touches that make it feel fresh and relevant. The outdoor seating area looks particularly appealing for warmer days, promising a fantastic spot for people-watching or just enjoying the breeze. Everything about the aesthetic suggests a well-thought-out concept, and I can already envision this place buzzing with energy during peak hours. It clearly has the bones to be a local favorite.**",

We were seated in a small room with 5 tables which was fine except that it was stuffy and a good look around the outdated room revealed a great deal of dust on rails etc. this of course makes you ask. What is the cleanliness in the kitchen? We had the tamales which was dry and the fois gras which was good. The squash was excellent and the spinach salad was excellent but way overdressed. We also had the lobster and basil pasta, which unfortunately was quite oily and the lobster was a bit tough, detracting from the overall dish.

This is how it was ACTUALLY paid off $13,000 was the trade in value that the dealership paid, $500 was my own money Imad added without my knowledge, making it seem like the dealership covered the full balance.

Demand to see and verify every detail yourself before signing. Protect your money and learn from my terrible experience.",
        "Back in 2007, my car (BMW 540i sport) was involved in a minor accident and one of the front rims was damaged (18\" M Parallel). The bodyshop (whom I had a working relationship with as I am a former auto dealer) outsourced finding a replacement to Wheel Specialists. Wheel Specialists sent the body shop a replica M Parallel. The rim was obviously a replica as the lip was slightly different, the color was slightly different, and the rim lacked the OEM BMW markings. Getting an OEM rim was very important as the OEM rims perfectly matched the other three, ensuring consistent handling, aesthetics, and preserving the vehicle's value. The replica was an immediate red flag. My bodyshop relayed my insistence on an OEM part, but Wheel Specialists seemed intent on pushing the cheaper alternative. As a former auto dealer, I found their attempt to pass off a non-OEM part as suitable for a high-performance BMW utterly unprofessional and deceptive. This wasn't just a visual mismatch; it was about integrity. I ultimately sourced an OEM rim elsewhere. Based on this, I cannot recommend their services.",
        "Craving some chips, salsa, and a burrito, a small group of us sauntered into Pasqual's earlier this week. We were immediately seated (in the bar area), and placed an order for some brews. Two of the brews were unavailable - they had sold out. Substitutions were made and chips with queso were ordered. I'm familiar with many styles of queso... but I was shocked by Pasqual's \"queso\" - it was more like a soft-spread, nearly liquid, and utterly devoid of the expected cheesy richness. It felt more like a warmed, bland dip from a jar than actual queso. A truly bizarre offering.\n\nOur burritos, thankfully, were a different story. Generously sized and packed with flavorful fillings, they were a redeeming highlight. The chips were decent, and the salsa offered a pleasant, zesty kick. Service was a bit sluggish, possibly due to our bar seating, and the initial beer availability issue was a minor letdown. While the burritos prevented a complete culinary disappointment, that queso left a lasting, rather unappetizing impression. I might consider returning for a burrito, but the queso is a definite no-go.",
        "I had a reservation for a compact car for 4 days. At the upstairs counter I declined to upgrade to a larger car for $5 per day. According to the Enterprise website, a compact car is a Nissan Versa, a Toyota Yaris, or similar. Anything similar to those two cars would have suited our needs perfectly. When we arrived at the cars in the parking garage, I was told we would be in a Fiat 500. While I am sure the Fiat would have been fun to drive, it was much too small for our needs. Looking at the technical specifications for the Fiat 500, it's clearly a subcompact, not a compact. Its cargo volume and passenger space are significantly less than a Versa or Yaris. We had luggage that simply wouldn't fit, completely derailing our travel plans. This felt like a major downgrade, especially after declining an upgrade. It caused significant stress and inconvenience. Not what I expect from a reputable rental company.",
        "I'm training for my first full marathon in January, and with some longer training runs on the horizon I figured it was time for some new running shoes.\n\nI came in on a Tuesday night, and walked into what was some sort of sponsored night for a high school cross country team so the place was plenty busy. I thought about going somewhere else or just coming back some other time, but instead I browsed some of the shoes I've been eyeballing online. I saw their foot analysis station, with a wait behind all those with the cross country people. When I was about to just leave, a staff member, Sarah, quickly approached me. Despite the chaos, she ensured I received personalized attention, guiding me efficiently through their excellent foot analysis. She then brought out several perfect options based on my running style and marathon needs. I left with a pair that felt custom-made and ready for the miles ahead. The dedication to customer service, even on such a busy night, was truly impressive. This place knows running shoes!",
        "I have been here twice now. Once when they were brand new, and then again this past weekend.\n\nTHIS CLUB SUCKS! If you want an expensive, overly-hyped, WAY overcrowded club (they don't care about safety/fire hazards at XS - AT ALL!) that loves to drop the beat after every song, this is for you.\n\nThe first time, we had bottle service for my friend's birthday. He is usually pretty chill, but even with our table, the crowd was stifling. The DJ's constant beat-dropping every 30 seconds ruined any potential vibe; it was jarring and amateurish.\n\nMy second visit was just as bad. It's a beautiful venue, but management clearly prioritizes profit over a safe, enjoyable experience. Save your money and sanity; there are far better clubs in Vegas.",
        "I have found my new favorite AYCE sushi joint in Vegas now. Before coming here, I was a fan of Yama Sushi, which is still really yummy, but now that I've been introduced to this place, I don't know...I think I might have to come here now rather than Yama. \n\nWe arrived with a party of 6 and the hostess told us it would take about an hour and 15 minutes or so. The place is small with a main dining area and two larger tables to the side of the restaurant for larger parties. We decided to wait it out, and thankfully, we were seated a bit sooner, around the one-hour mark. Once inside, the energy was palpable. The service was prompt and friendly, even with the busy atmosphere. The sushi itself was incredibly fresh, the rolls were creative and generously sized, and the nigiri had the perfect rice-to-fish ratio. Everything tasted premium, a step above what I'm used to. The variety was excellent too. This spot truly impressed me, making the wait entirely worthwhile. I'm already planning my next visit!",
        "Where do we start? The place is hot, dusty, very crowded, and so disorganized. Okay that aside, the reason why were giving this event a 1 star ( 0 if possible) is the false advertisement to various ticket sellers. They proudly say \"trucks are asked to sell food on low price\" this is well printed and customer service even answer this question on their website. Well let me save you the precious time, money and save you from getting angry. Not only you have to pay (12) dollars for entrance, you also have to pay parking (5). And then, the \"low price\" food trucks? Forget it. We saw a single taco going for $7, a small plate of fries for $10, and a bottled water for $4. These are resort prices, not the \"low prices\" promised. It felt like a blatant bait-and-switch operation. The lines for everything were ridiculously long, the atmosphere was chaotic, and the supposed \"deals\" were nowhere to be found. Save yourself the headache and the money; this event is a complete rip-off and a prime example of false advertising. Avoid at all costs!",
        "I LOVE LOVE LOOOOOOVED XS! Julie F. picked a great spot for our 2nd night in Vegas!!!\n\nApparently there was no guestlist for the 4th of July weekend, so some of us girls had to go early to avoid the long line. We got to XS around 9:30, and the line looked really long already. No biggie, we had our \"cranberry juice\" to keep us occupied in line. We weren't even half way done with our juice when the bouncer said... \"you ladies are all set, head right in!\" Talk about a pleasant surprise! We breezed past hundreds of people still waiting, feeling like VIPs without actually being VIPs. Inside, the energy was electric. The pool area was buzzing, the music was pumping, and the light show was insane. We grabbed some ridiculously expensive but necessary drinks \u2013 it's Vegas, after all \u2013 and hit the dance floor. The DJ was incredible, playing banger after banger, and the crowd was just vibing. We danced until our feet hurt, laughed until our sides ached, and made memories that will definitely last a lifetime. XS absolutely lived up to the hype and then some. If you're looking for an unforgettable night out in Vegas, this is your spot. Thanks again, Julie, for the epic recommendation!",
        "We were in town for one Saturday night and walked around the area hoping to find a place for dinner. We stepped in Bonaparte and felt embarrassed by being underdressed. However they still accommodated us for a table for 2 in this busy evening.\n\nWhen we were looking at the menu prices, we thought it was all about the nice decor. Once we started our meal, we immediately realized knew that the quality & presentation worth such prices.\n\nI had soup of the day (red vegetable soup) and a lobster salad. The soup was incredibly rich and flavorful, clearly made with fresh, vibrant vegetables. It was a perfect warm start. My lobster salad was an absolute masterpiece \u2013 generous chunks of sweet, perfectly cooked lobster on crisp greens, artfully arranged. Every bite burst with freshness and exquisite taste. The presentation alone was stunning.\n\nDespite our initial hesitation about the cost and our attire, Bonaparte proved to be an unforgettable dining experience. The impeccable service, sophisticated ambiance, and truly exceptional food made it worth every penny. Highly recommended for a special occasion, even if you just stumble upon it!",
        "A seductive female devil sporting a two piece bikini, thigh high boots and a pitch fork surrounded by flames & palm trees got my attention. While staying at the Monte Carlo on Las Vegas Blvd we thought we hit the jackpot having a Diablo's Cantina attached to the hotel. The food was kick-ass, I will give them that. The guacamole was creamy, packed with just the right amount of heat and was topped with diced tomatoes & a sprinkle of fresh sea salt. We also ordered the chicken nachos, holy shit they were huge. Seriously, those chicken nachos were a massive, cheesy, meaty mountain that could easily feed multiple people! The atmosphere was lively and fun, perfect for a Vegas night. Their margaritas were also potent and delicious, perfectly complementing the spicy food. Service was efficient and friendly. Diablo's Cantina is definitely a vibrant spot for fantastic Mexican food right on the Strip. Don't miss it!",
        "The only reason they got a star is because the food was good. My family wanted bagels this rainy morning so I jumped in my car knowing that Einstein's had a drive through.. yay! After a VERY long drive through wait (which I didn't even mind initially, figuring it was just busy), I finally received my order. On my way home, I was smart enough to check my order (was going to do it at the window but seeing that there were tons of cars behind me, I put faith in the Einstein workers... big mistake). They completely forgot over half of my cream cheese!\n\nLittle irritated (and pregnant, so my patience is already thinner than usual), I was faced with the choice of driving all the way back or making do with dry bagels. It's incredibly frustrating when you pay good money for an order and a fundamental component like cream cheese is just missing. While the bagels themselves were delicious, the overall experience was severely marred by this oversight. It really makes you question their attention to detail. Next time, I'll be checking *everything* before pulling away, no matter the line.",
        "The library kicksass and here is why. So you want to read a book? Head over to http://library.scottsdaleaz.gov/ and you can easily check their catalog. If they have it, awesome, go grab it! If it's currently checked out, no problem at all \u2013 you can place a hold online. They'll even send you a convenient email notification as soon as it's returned and ready for pickup, holding it for you for a generous 10 days.\n\nBut it's not just about books! This place is a treasure trove of entertainment. They boast a fantastic collection of DVDs and even VHS movies for those who appreciate a classic. You can check out up to 10 of these at a time, and you get a full three weeks to enjoy them. The variety is genuinely impressive, covering everything from new releases to old favorites. It's truly an invaluable community resource.",
        "Let me preface this by saying that I was raised on Steak 'N Shake and am from where it originated. It's been a family institution for 8 decades. My parents frequented the original SnS. My grandparents frequented the original SnS & knew the Belt family. For all the Yelpers out there, I simply ask that, before you write off Steak 'N Shake based on a 'Signature' 1/2 store that is the Tempe location, please try eating at an actual sit-down classic Steak 'N Shake restaurant. The Signature store is a truncated, fast-casual concept, not the full diner experience. It misses the extensive menu, classic atmosphere, and often, the consistent quality of a traditional Steak 'N Shake. Many negative reviews here likely stem from this specific location's limitations. To truly appreciate why this chain has endured for generations and offers such incredible value (especially the Steakburgers and milkshakes), find a full-service, classic location. You'll discover a significant difference and hopefully, a new appreciation for this American classic.",
        "OK...here's the story. It's about 3 AM. I'm mid-strip and feeling a bit hungry, Need something to absorb a bit of the beverages consumed earlier. I walk into the IP. I see an advertisement for the Burger Palace just upstairs on the third floor. Sounds like it might hit the spot!\n\nI arrive on the third floor. I see the Burger Palace. Reminds of a desolate snack bar in 1970's era bowling alley. The place smells of grease and a general funk. The menu is posted on a board behind the counter. The lone employee grunted a 'what do ya want?' I ordered the cheeseburger and fries, desperately hoping for greasy comfort. What arrived was a sad, grey patty on a stale bun with limp lettuce and lukewarm, soggy fries. This 'food' didn't hit the spot; it just deepened my regret. The 'palace' in the name is a cruel joke. I ate half out of desperation, then left. Save your late-night cravings for literally anywhere else. This place is a monument to poor choices.",
        "Eek! Methinks not was exactly what I was thinking when walking around the buffet area. My boyfriend has been staying at the Las Vegas Hotel for our budget trips and the casino gave us two complimentary buffet passes for dinner. They were FREE buffet passes, but I am still giving it one star. The regular price for dinner was around $21.00 per person and that is definitely NOT worth the price for this buffet.\n\nFood:\nOrange Chicken: Their orange chicken is pretty much microwaved chicken nuggets with an orange syrup sauce. If I had the palette of a five-year-old, maybe I'd be impressed. As an adult, it was thoroughly disappointing. The 'mashed potatoes' were watery and flavorless, clearly from a box. The 'carving station' offered dry, overcooked beef that tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. Even the salad bar looked sad and wilted. For $21, I expect fresh, well-prepared food, not something that looks like it came from a cheap school cafeteria. Save your money, even if it's 'free' \u2013 it's not worth the stomach space.",
        "An impressively good pub considering its recent opening. The moment you step inside, you're greeted by an open and inviting atmosphere, decorated in a tasteful, traditional manner that feels both classic and fresh. Despite its seemingly large feel, the pub is actually not too big, making it cozy without feeling cramped. There's plenty of comfortable seating scattered throughout, including a nice little alcove towards the front that offers a bit more privacy.\n\nWhat really stands out is their fantastic selection of drinks. They boast a regularly replenished supply of real ale, ensuring there's always something new and interesting for ale enthusiasts. Beyond that, their wide selection of whiskies is truly impressive, catering to connoisseurs and casual sippers alike. Prices are very reasonable, especially given the quality and variety on offer, meaning you can enjoy a great evening without breaking the bank. This place has quickly become a local favorite, and I highly recommend checking it out.",
        "These guys are doing something interesting, and I like it. Gourmet hotdogs with Korean-style toppings? Genius! I thought my lunch here was great, and my only wish is that they were closer to my job!\n\nI ordered the Angry Hotdog ($4.95), which was a fantastic blend of savory and a subtle kick. But the true highlight was the Angry Kimchi fries ($4.95). These were sweet potato fries, generously covered in tangy kimchi, a perfectly cooked egg over easy, succulent bulgogi, and a sprinkle of Korean spices. It had a small little bite to it that I actually would have preferred stronger, but it was still incredibly flavorful. The fries didn't quite come together as a neat dish, making for a delightfully messy, yet utterly satisfying, flavor explosion. A must-try!",
        "I feel like in the last year - I have had drinks and eats here more then anywhere else in the city. I really want to give this place 5 stars but there are definitely some areas that need improvement.\n\nWhat doesn't need improvement - at least in my opinion - is the food and drink. The food is bar food but it is well-priced and there is a good amount of diversity on the menu. I typically order the baked italian sub, the buffalo chicken wrap, and the turkey bacon wedgie (that's right wedgie). The Pizzas are also surprisingly good, with a perfectly crisp crust and generous toppings, making them a fantastic option for sharing. Every single dish I've tried has been consistently delicious and offers incredible value, especially for a casual spot.\n\nHowever, the \"areas for improvement\" primarily revolve around the service consistency and the overall atmosphere at peak times. While some staff members are absolutely stellar and attentive, others can be a bit inattentive, leading to longer waits for refills or the check. The place can also get incredibly loud and crowded, making conversation difficult. If they could just iron out these minor kinks, this would easily be my go-to 5-star spot. I'm truly rooting for them to get there!",
        "We had a schedule appliance repair contracted through our home warranty company. The scheduled appointment was between 9am - noon on 06-06-2012. Our entire morning was blocked, anticipating their arrival. At 12:20, with no sign or call, we proactively called to inquire. We were informed the technician was running 30 minutes late, pushing the expected arrival to 12:50pm. We patiently waited, adjusting our plans once more.\n\nHowever, at 12:55pm, instead of a technician, I received an astonishing call from Sears, asking if our refrigerator was working and if we were satisfied! I promptly told the woman from India that absolutely no one had shown up. Her response was even more shocking: the ticket had been closed out. This is beyond unacceptable. We wasted an entire day for a no-show, only to discover the company falsely claimed the service was completed. Completely unprofessional and a gross misrepresentation of service. Avoid!",
        "Came here with my mom for brunch today at around 12:30, was told it would be around a 20 minute wait. They sent me the ready text in around 10-15 minutes. The menu was big, lots of yummy sounding items so it took me a while to decide what I wanted.\n\nI ended up ordering the lucky 7's: 2 pancakes, 2 sausage links, 3 eggs any style, & breakfast potatoes. DELICIOUS. Their breakfast puts places like IHOP & Denny's to shame. I couldn't even finish half of my plate! The portions are incredibly generous, and the quality is top-notch. Every component was delicious. Our server was also very attentive and friendly. This place blows chain diners out of the water! We'll definitely be back for more, perhaps with a plan to share. Highly recommend this brunch spot!",

Even the cocktail service, which used to be fairly prompt, is now practically non-existent.

        "Everything about our experience at My Big Fat Greek Restaurant was clouded by the fact that our waitress was IRRITABLE. She took one look at us and was instantly done. I mean, can you blame her? We were 6 well-dressed 30-somethings having a leisurely dinner and drinks before the theatre. (Can you feel my sarcasm??) Sorry about that, but seriously? We were, like, the perfect table that evening. Big fat check at the end of the meal should have equaled big fat tip for her. Instead, we got sighs when we asked for water, plates practically slammed on the table, and incredibly long waits for drink refills. Our questions about the menu were met with curt, one-word answers. It genuinely felt like we were an imposition rather than valued customers. While the food itself was decent and the atmosphere charming, her utterly dismissive attitude completely soured what should have been a lovely pre-theatre evening. It\u2019s a real shame, because we were ready to become regulars. Sadly, when service is this off-putting, even good food can\u2019t save the experience. We won't be back.",
        "This place a must go to place for great drinks, great food, and a nice gastropub feel. A friend introduced us to this gem, and since he was good friends with the owner/chef, we were incredibly fortunate to try so many delicious dishes off their menu right from the start. Every single bite was a delight! What's even more impressive is that the staff are consistently amazing and super friendly, even on the many other occasions we've visited without our friend. We've celebrated everything from birthdays to New Year's Eve here, and it's also our go-to for random dinner and brunch events. The atmosphere is always lively but comfortable. Reservations are an absolute MUST \u2013 this place is getting hot off the press and fills up quickly. Seriously, don't miss out on this fantastic spot! Highly recommended.",
        "I'll be fair in saying that it's not the worst I've had because it wasn't, but please, for a restaurant in Vegas...\n\nMy friends took me here because we would get entry to the club if we ate at the restaurant - now, I'm not big on spending loads of money on food, I prefer the simple yet delicious; but I thought, hell, it's a Vegas joint so it's bound to hit the spot.\n\nI was disappointed. My friend got sushi, it was really good. My other friend got swordfish, which was just okay. My own dish, the supposedly 'crispy' duck, was anything but \u2013 chewy, dry, and swimming in an oily, uninspired sauce. The accompanying rice was clumpy and cold. For a Vegas restaurant, the quality was shockingly low for the price. The club entry was the only real value, and frankly, I'd rather pay the cover next time than eat here again.",
        "I took my mom, sister, and niece to the Slider Truck at the Farmers' Market on Eastern and Richmar (Serene-ish). My niece was absolutely flabbergasted by the \"little sammiches truck,\" and her excitement was truly contagious. She pretty much made me order everything on the menu, which, to my pleasant surprise, included a fantastic secret item that wasn't listed! Pro tip: Always ask if there's a special not on the menu \u2013 you might just discover your new favorite!\n\nI have two favorites from their amazing selection. One being the Pulled Porky, listed as a specialty slider (and sadly, limited, so get it while you can!). The pork was tender, smoky, and perfectly sauced, a true masterpiece in miniature form. My second favorite, which totally blew me away, was the Spicy Chickpea slider. It was surprisingly flavorful with just the right amount of kick, proving they cater to all tastes. Everything we tried was fresh and incredibly delicious. This truck is a must-visit for anyone at the market! We'll definitely be back for more tiny, tasty treasures.",
        "We had dinner here tonight for the first time. After reading several reviews in the paper about Liberty Market, and being fans of Joe's Farm Grill and Real BBQ, we were determined to get in here. We parked in the back and as we walked along the sidewalk next to Liberty Market we noticed the long line trailing out of Joe's Real BBQ and then noticed the crowd inside Liberty Market. I was instantly impressed that someone can be so successful in today's shaky market and open restaurant after restaurant with business just booming.\n\nAs we walked in we noticed that there was a line for ordering, but it moved quickly. The vibrant atmosphere and charming decor were inviting. We ordered the Brick Oven Pizza and amazing Brussels Sprouts \u2013 both were incredibly fresh and flavorful. Despite the crowd, service was efficient and friendly. Liberty Market absolutely lived up to the hype and high standards of its sister restaurants. A truly fantastic experience!",

Walking down to the restaurant we were greeted and told it would be a minute. The staff and waiters were very cordial. The place was packed full of people and the noise level was definitely high, a lively hum from the NYE crowd and the Stanford pep rally. Despite the buzz, we were seated quickly. Our server was incredibly attentive and efficient, handling the packed room expertly. The food was excellent \u2013 every dish was delicious and beautifully presented.

        "This was my first and last experience at the Vintage. My friend and I, drawn by a BOGO coupon, hoped for a nice, affordable lunch on a late Sunday afternoon. The experience was horrible from the start. Despite being empty, we waited 3-5 minutes for the hostess, who returned from the bathroom. The bartender offered no help, and two other staff members completely ignored us. This immediate lack of attentiveness set a terrible tone.\n\nOnce seated, service remained abysmal. Our server took ages to acknowledge us and seemed utterly disengaged. The food, when it finally arrived, was a huge disappointment. My burger was overcooked and dry; my friend's salad looked sad and unappetizing. Even with the BOGO deal, the low quality made it feel like a complete rip-off. We couldn't wait to leave. Save your money and time; there are far better lunch spots. This place desperately needs an overhaul in both staff training and kitchen quality.",

Very quaint, family-run breakfast/lunch spot.\n\nWe arrived just after 11 and had a 20 min wait. Thank goodness for the gorgeous Fall weather. Our name was finally called and a 10-13 year old brought us to our table. Normally, the idea of children working in a restaurant annoys me. Restaurants is a serious business and throwing your underaged kids in the mix is more distracting than it is helpful. But this young man was an absolute delight! He was polite, efficient, and charming, perfectly fitting the family vibe. I ordered the Challah French Toast, a fluffy, golden dream. My boyfriend's Chorizo Scramble was flavorful and hearty. Everything was fresh, hot, and delicious. Our main server was equally attentive. The whole atmosphere felt genuinely warm and welcoming. Despite the wait, it was absolutely worth it for such a fantastic meal. We'll definitely be back!",

        "I was looking forward to their opening and now I feel I need to wait a few months longer before I try again. On a Friday night, we arrived eager to try the new spot. After a good five minutes waiting awkwardly by the door, a hostess/server finally approached. Her first question wasn't about seating, but if we planned to order food, as the kitchen was \"really backed up\" and orders would take \"well over an hour.\"\n\nNaturally, that instantly killed our desire for food. We replied, \"No, just here for a beer or two,\" feeling deflated. Soon after, we were seated. While new places have kinks, a 5-minute wait followed by a 60+ minute food delay warning at the door is a significant red flag. It felt like they were trying to deter food orders rather than manage expectations. The beer was fine, but the experience felt very much like a training wheels phase. I hope they sort out staffing and kitchen flow soon; the space has potential.",
        "Sunday morning in the casino at the Palms is like being in God's waiting room. Having said that, it seems that the Palms is either a property with a 3-way split personality or it's having an identity crisis. Or both.\n\nI see 3 distinct things going on here: They clearly market and cater to the older local population, evidenced by crowds toting the most recent giveaway, which happened to be bathrobes. Yes, bathrobes. Now don't get me wrong, BJ and I have had a lot of fun with our own Palms bathrobes, enjoying their comfort, fitting that \"local's lounge\" vibe.\n\nThen there's the high-end, trendy persona, luring a younger crowd with upscale dining and former nightlife. A stark contrast. Lastly, there's the more generic \"resort\" personality, with its movie theater and bowling, catering to a broader, family-oriented demographic. It feels like three different hotels crammed into one. This lack of a cohesive identity leaves you wondering, \"Who exactly is this place for?\" It's an interesting, if somewhat disjointed, mix.",

The second time around was not as satisfying as the first. This visit, unfortunately, fell short of the high expectations set previously. From the start, the bread, usually a warm comfort, arrived disappointingly cold. Our waiter also neglected to inform us about certain added charges, which was an unwelcome surprise when the bill arrived. The biggest letdown, however, was my prime rib. I specifically ordered it medium-rare, expecting that perfect pink center and tender texture. Instead, it was nearly well-done and incredibly chewy. After just four bites, I was genuinely sad and disheartened that my celebratory meal was such a stark contrast to my first delightful visit. It makes me question if the magic was just a one-time thing.",
        "We (5 of us) went into mcfaddens on 3/19/14 at approximately 7:13, we were sat and 10 mins went by and nobody saw us. I check the time because I'm a server myself and know about seeing people within 90 secs and we were pressed for time because we were going to a concert. So I went up to bar, after another 3 mins the bartender asked what I need and I said no one has seen us and it's been a while. The bartender came out and offered us drinks, I said we needed to order and he then offered to take our food order directly. We quickly ordered, stressing our deadline. Drinks arrived, but the long wait ensued. Appetizers finally showed up 25 minutes later, barely leaving time before rushed, unappetizing entrees landed. We had to literally scarf down the mediocre food, making us significantly late for our concert. It felt like a comedy of errors; good intentions from the bartender couldn't fix the broken system. For a place catering to pre-event crowds, they utterly missed the mark on efficiency and attentiveness. We definitely won't be returning, especially not when on a schedule.",
        "This is strictly a beer review. Happy hour looks promising though.\n\nLooking for a man date or a sporty classy bar to escape the fam bam for a few hours? This Rock Bottom brewery might be a good place to start. I came in at noon, and there were already four pairs of guys drinking beer and watching ESPN highlights. Clearly, this is the place to go for the midday work lunch with a good guy friend.\n\nOn the beer front, I tried their Hop Bomb IPA, which was pleasantly hoppy without being overly bitter \u2013 a solid choice. The selection of their in-house brews was diverse enough to satisfy most palates. Unfortunately, the Cardinals got stomped on during the highlights, so everyone was in a bit of a sour mood. Despite the sports disappointment, the local patrons were at least friendly enough to hide their collective dismay, creating a surprisingly welcoming atmosphere even in defeat. If you're seeking good brews and a relaxed, sports-friendly spot, this Rock Bottom is worth checking out.",
        "Bank of America was my first bank after switching from a credit union. I banked with them for a couple years, and a few months after I turned 18, they told me in the branch that I was approved for a student credit card to be used for overdraft protection. I thought that was great, as I was still learning to balance a checkbook and rarely had much in my account at a time. I filled out all the paperwork, and the teller said it would be applied right away as a backup.\n\nWell, that didn't happen. A few weeks later, a small transaction put my account into the negative. Instead of the promised protection, I was hit with a hefty $35 overdraft fee. Confused and frustrated, I went back to the branch, only to be told the credit card had never actually been set up on my account. Despite filling out all the forms and receiving assurance from their staff, the backup I relied on simply wasn't there. It felt like a bait and switch, leaving me with an unexpected charge and a complete lack of trust. This experience taught me a valuable lesson about relying on verbal assurances from large institutions.",
        "Don't go here for your banking. Their customer service is terrible and they are incompetent. I wanted to get away from the big banks because I'd heard that the smaller banks, like credit unions, were better. So far, they are no better. In fact, the customer service at Bank of America was WAY better; at least I could get a live person whenever I needed it. Reaching a live person at the credit union is next to impossible in my experience. They clearly prefer you use their automated system, which is useless for anything complex, or simply give up. I've spent countless hours on hold, often disconnected or shuffled between departments lacking authority to resolve even basic issues. It's incredibly frustrating when you can't get a human to assist with a specific problem. This credit union has proven to be an absolute nightmare, making me reconsider my entire banking strategy. Avoid at all costs if you value your time and sanity.",
        "I usually love maggianos and visit at least once a month but my lunch experience today has made me hesitant to visit again. My boyfriend and I made a lunch reservation to celebrate his promotion at work. We arrived and noticed the reservation wasn't necessary in the less than half full restaurant. Still, we were seated in a terrible table situated next to the kitchen doors and a server station and next to a large party. Not the quiet romantic lunch we had hoped for. It was all downhill from there. Our server was pushy and unattentive. Whenever myself or my boyfriend tried to get his attention, he was abrupt or simply vanished. Drinks were empty, food was slow and lukewarm. Our special celebration turned into a truly disappointing and frustrating experience. We left feeling completely let down, and now question returning.",
        "Sorry. Can't give this place more than 2 stars for a couple reasons. First time I came here, the waitress was really sweet, but forgot to put in my boyfriend's order for a shake, and neither of us were that terribly excited about the food we did receive, especially for the price. Also, I realize it may be hotel policy, but they wouldn't honor our Harrah's comp voucher unless we charged the meal to the room.\n\nSecond time, I go to place a to-go order for a burger and fries. Hostess says I need to go to the bar to place a to-go order, which seemed odd with the dining room nearly empty. I waited 15 minutes for a simple burger and fries, only to be underwhelmed again by the quality for the price. The consistent issues \u2013 from forgotten items and inflexible comp policies to inconvenient ordering and disappointing food \u2013 make it clear this isn't the place for us. There are far better dining options nearby that actually deliver on value and service. I won't be giving them a third chance.",
        "I'd give this company location no stars if possible. On Thursday, March 21 I arrived to pick up a car I'd reserved over a week prior. The king of the Enterprise rental counter, whose name I wish I'd gotten so that I could name and shame him, had a terrible, condescending attitude right off the bat. It's one thing if your reason for not honoring my reservation is some wonky company policy, but it is quite another to talk down to me in a smarmy voice, be needlessly difficult, and offer absolutely no solutions or alternatives, despite me having a confirmed reservation.\n\nHe essentially shrugged, implying it was *my* problem, not theirs, that they couldn't provide the vehicle I booked. This level of unprofessionalism and disregard for a customer's time and plans is simply unacceptable. I left without a car, utterly frustrated and forced to scramble for last-minute transportation. Avoid this location unless you enjoy being treated with utter contempt and having your plans ruined by incompetent staff.",
        "My cousin and I went to Vegas with a group of friends for Labor Day weekend and well we HAD to get our hair done for the club. So glad dry bars are everywhere now. I found this place on yelp and decided to check it out. It's a fairly new place and less than 10 minutes from the strip.\n\nAs soon as we entered, they greeted us and offered us bottled water while we filled out an info card. Very nice and clean place!\nThey start off by washing your hair and giving you an incredible 5-10 minute head massage that was incredible. My stylist quickly gave me the perfect bouncy blowout, and my cousin's hair looked fantastic too. We were both club-ready in an hour! Our styles lasted all night. The staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was great. This is our new Vegas glam spot. Highly recommend!",
        "okay, i dont get what the employees' problems are here but i felt as if i was a big bad criminal about to steal overpriced lollipops & candy. NOT!!! i dont even have a big sweet tooth to begin with!\n\nmy bf and i were walking down the strip and decided, \"hey why not stop in here for a bit?\" so we did, but once we got in we were greeted..which yes i totally get it, customer service all the guests...yes yes yes. but i dont know about being stopped and then immediately shadowed through the aisles. It wasn't a helpful 'can I assist you?' vibe; it was a constant, unsettling watch. Every employee seemed to eye us suspiciously, making us feel incredibly unwelcome. We just wanted to browse, but the intense scrutiny made the experience so awkward we bought nothing and practically sprinted out. Definitely not the fun candy stop we envisioned. I won't be returning to feel like a shoplifter.",
        "Awesome hotel, beautiful suites - with bathrooms the size of a typical NYC hotel room, incredible pool deck, great staff, great service, excellent elevators, excellent housekeeping. Our recent stay here was largely fantastic, with the spacious suites being a definite highlight \u2013 the bathrooms felt like an extra room! The cleanliness was impeccable, thanks to the diligent housekeeping, and the elevators were always swift and efficient.\n\nHowever, the front desk could certainly use quite a few more clerks. While the staff members there were very, very nice, it would be incredibly helpful if they could be both nice and efficient. It consistently took about 6-10 minutes for each check-in, which felt quite long.\n\nOnce you get past the lobby, the pool areas are absolutely fantastic! There are multiple heated pools, plenty of nice lounge chairs, and they provide towels and chair covers. There are also lots of bars around, though be prepared \u2013 they definitely make a lot of money off those $10 drinks! Overall, a wonderful place to stay despite the check-in wait.",
        "Oh Modern Grove, you were so pretty - yes, you turned my head and I was draw into your inner sanctum - once again, so lovely - a delightful place to hang out and have a beer - like a little section of hipster Santa Monica brought into the desert - as a bar, I would give you 4 stars, but as a restaurant, I'm sorry to say, all style and not much substance.\n\nMore specifically, I ordered the white sauce pizza with the cured ham and the arugula - it sounded good but as I sat down with my slice, the crust was limp, almost soggy, and the white sauce surprisingly flavorless. The cured ham was sparse, and the arugula couldn't rescue the overall blandness. It felt like a pizza designed for looks, not for taste. My partner's sandwich was equally uninspired. While the ambiance truly shines, making it a fantastic spot for a drink, the food sadly falls flat. Come for the vibe, stay for a beer, but maybe eat elsewhere.",
        "Las Vegas is known for The Strip, several miles of massive resort casinos that will do just about anything to catch a visitor's attention. City Center complex is no exception.\n\nThis ultra modern, sleek design mixed use area is home to the Mandarin Oriental hotel. Upon entering the MO, guests travel up to the twenty-third floor to the Sky Lobby a refreshingly unique concept. However the Tea Lounge is just sort of there by the check-in desk. It has all the charm of a Starbucks kiosk in any lobby in any hotel in any major city in the **world. For a Mandarin Oriental, renowned for luxury and detail, this was a letdown.**\n\n**The Sky Lobby is stunning, yet the Tea Lounge utterly fails to meet that expectation. No distinct seating, no special decor, just a few tables awkwardly placed near the check-in queue. It feels like an afterthought, a missed opportunity for a memorable high tea experience fitting such a prestigious hotel. While the tea might be good, the generic environment detracts from any sense of occasion. It's a shame; the MO usually excels, but this spot really misses the mark.**",
        "Conveniently placed close to the airport, rental car service also close by with big rooms that are clean and come with basic needs. I came in with my mother to the lobby where our room had already been reserved, showed proof and was given our two room keys and directions to our room. We took our car around back and was able to park right in front of our hotel room. The basic room was spacious, with two Queen sized beds, bathroom/shower, TV, refrigerator, of course AC and wi-fi. We loved our stay!\n\nThe convenience after a long flight was a huge plus, especially with direct parking right outside our door. The beds were comfortable, and the room felt fresh and well-maintained. The fridge was handy, and both the AC and Wi-Fi worked perfectly without any issues. While not a luxury spot, it definitely exceeded expectations for a practical, comfortable overnight stay. For anyone needing a hassle-free stop near the airport, this is an excellent choice. We would certainly consider staying here again.",
        "Came here with my boyfriend last weekend for a living social deal we got, which was a total steal! It was $199 for Friday 3pm -Sunday 1pm in a suite with a King SIze bed (plus 100 bucks towards the spa, 2 free breakfast buffets, and 6 free bowling games). Didn't really know what to expect because we've never stayed anywhere in Vegas except for the strip.\n\nOverall, we were pleasantly surprised that this place was pretty nice! The hotel itself is pretty modern and luxurious for the price we paid. The room was spacious and clean, with a super comfy king-size bed and a great view. We used our spa credit for a couples massage, which was incredibly relaxing and a perfect treat. The breakfast buffet was delicious with plenty of options, and we had a blast with our free bowling games. It was such a refreshing change from the usual Strip hustle and bustle. This place definitely exceeded our expectations for an off-Strip stay and we'd highly recommend it!",
        "Seriously if you have not been here yet - get in your car and get over there. I went because it got good reviews, it was new to me and it was Mexican food which was what I wanted today. Big surprise - fantastic food.\n\nThe restaurant is not in a swanky neighborhood but don't let that stop you. They are in a shopping center that has several other restaurants, some closed, and a sports bar. Look for it because it is not obvious.\n\nFrom the pictures on yelp you might think they do not have many tables or much space. Don't let the photos fool you! The interior is surprisingly roomy, clean, and inviting, with a vibrant, authentic feel. We were seated promptly, and the service was incredibly friendly and attentive. The menu is extensive, offering all the classics. We tried the carne asada and the chile relleno; both were absolutely delicious and clearly made with fresh ingredients. The salsa bar was also a fantastic touch. This place is a must-visit for truly great Mexican food, proving that looks can be deceiving.",
        "This is probably one of the most disappointing meals we've had from a chef of this high caliber. Perhaps because the restaurant is newly opened and the menu hasn't been perfected (well, that is still no excuse for overcooking beef)? Unlike the other low rating reviewer - service was really good for us. ambiance and table seating and arrangement was also not an issue. The only problem we had was entirely on the food. I like the different tasting dishes but some times it felt really disjointed and confused, as if the kitchen was trying too hard to be innovative without a clear, cohesive vision.\n\nThere was no discernible narrative flow; flavors often clashed rather than complemented, and the transitions between courses felt jarringly abrupt. One dish would be intensely savory, followed by something surprisingly bland, then another with an overpowering single note. The 'signature' lamb, for instance, was not only under-seasoned but felt completely isolated from the rest of the meal. For a chef of this reputation and the premium price point, we expected a thoughtful, cohesive culinary journey, not a series of disconnected experiments. The execution simply fell short of the mark, making a return visit unlikely anytime soon.",
        "This place is 3 stores in one, a restaurant, a bakery and a meat market. I would give the restaurant 2.5 stars, the bakery 4 stars and meat market 5+stars.\n\nI've only eaten at the restaurant once; my Mom and her husband love this place - so on her recommendation a couple friends and I went for a prime rib dinner. My friends and I are not young, but we were the youngest people there. No problem, it was 8pm and we were starving. We each ordered the prime rib dinner which came with soup, potato, and a side salad. The prime rib was decent, but unmemorable \u2013 under-seasoned and slightly overcooked for my preference. The soup was bland, making the whole meal feel like quantity over quality, thus the 2.5 stars.\n\nThe bakery, however, shines. Their fresh-baked bread and pastries are consistently excellent. I often grab their delicious rye bread or an apple turnover \u2013 easily 4 stars. But the real standout is the meat market. The quality of their cuts is outstanding, and the butchers are incredibly knowledgeable. Their steaks and homemade sausages are top-notch, making it my go-to for any special occasion. A definite 5+ stars!",
        "This is close to my house when I need to pick up something in a pinch. Like jasmine rice, soy sauce, or rice vinegar, it's super convenient for quick pantry restocks.\n\nBeing Thai, I find their Thai ingredient selection lacking \u2013 mostly pre-packaged curries and bottled sauces. For traditional Thai cooking, it really falls short. However, they do have lots of Korean and Indian items, which is fantastic if those are your culinary interests!\n\nThe produce section is nice, though missing staples like kaffir lime leaves or galangal. Lemongrass is hit-or-miss. They do offer nice fresh veggies like garlic and various Chinese greens, which are always a plus.\n\nWhile handy for everyday basics, don't expect a deep dive into Southeast Asian ingredients beyond Korean and Indian. It's a decent spot for quick grabs, but not a comprehensive Asian market for all cuisines. Good for what it is, but could definitely expand its Thai offerings!",
        "I really don't understand why this place has gotten so many stars. Its a weird setup. First, you go in, and stand in line (McDonalds style) to order a burger and drinks. Wait staff are shuffling next to you and jostling to get by. You're standing in line being jostled on one side and have a loud kitchen in the other. It's an awkward and unpleasant start. You pay, then find a table and wait for delivery. The whole process felt chaotic and far from relaxing.\n\nThen came the burgers. Frankly, they weren't great. The meat was surprisingly gummy, with the unsettling feel of biting into some gelatinous, gooey meat-like substance, completely lacking the texture of a proper patty. It left a rather unpleasant aftertaste. Given the high ratings, I was expecting a much better experience, both in terms of ambiance and, crucially, food quality. There are definitely better burger joints out there.",
        "This is a restaurant that has a lot of potential but right now is veryyyyyyy much missing the mark. First, if you're doing Thai, you might want to commit to the theme. I like football, but if you want to be a sports bar, be a sports bar. If you want to be a Thai restaurant, maybe play some Asian music? The big screen blasting a game really clashed with the menu. Now, on the service. My girlfriend was given a plate with a hair on it \u2013 probably our waitress's. Glad I caught it before she started eating, but you really have to be careful of that sort of thing. It's a basic hygiene standard. There was only one waitress for the whole restaurant, which explains some of the delays, but not the oversight on the plate. It's a shame, because the food itself wasn't bad, but the overall experience was just off.",
        "The Thunderbird Lounge, inside the Aruba Hotel and Spa on Las Vegas Blvd. between Oakey and Charleston, is classic Vegas, but not in the typical sense. No matter how many old black & white pictures of the Rat Pack and lounge acts they paste on the walls, this isn't a classic trip back to the \"glory days\" of mob Vegas. Try the the Plaza or Sahara for true nostalgia. The Thunderbird is more where you'd end up after Vegas stole your money, stole your lady, stole your heart but left your liver. A place where the drinks are stiff, the lights are low, and the only glitz is the neon reflecting in your glass. Forget fancy cocktails or curated playlists; this is a jukebox joint with cheap beer and a bartender who's heard every story. It's where locals go to escape the tourist traps, a gritty, unpretentious haven for those who appreciate the raw, unvarnished soul of old Vegas. No frills, no pretense, just authentic, dive-bar solace. It's the real deal, a welcome antidote to the Strip's manufactured fun, and a place to truly unwind.",
        "So incredibly pricey! For the price...not sure it's worth it. Our waiter was good and we were seated perfectly to people-watch the shoppers outside.\n\nWe started with the Calamari: Gluten-free, whaaaaat? Yes, it is! Not super crispy, but definitely nice flavor though slightly bland. The sweet and sour sauce instead of traditional cocktail/marinara was an unexpected twist, but not bad.\n\nThe Caesar salad was next. Very fresh and crispy. For the price of $13 though? It really was a slab of romaine lettuce with minimal dressing and cheese. It felt like a significant markup for something so basic. While the setting was pleasant and service attentive, the food's quality-to-cost ratio just didn't align. Come for the ambiance, maybe not the culinary value.",
        "Overall it is a very nice park to spend time at anytime during the year. The grounds are well taken care of and well lit at night, making it quite pleasant after dusk. I think it is the nicest park I go to that has a roller hockey rink in it. My friends and I like to use the roller hockey rink but we use it to play street hockey. We normally play there either Sunday mornings or nights and Wed nights. If you want to join us and play, look up \"Las Vegas Street Hockey\" on the Internet. The rink can get slippery due to some sand coming into it from the volleyball sand pit, so be mindful of your footing. It's a great local gem!",
        "Our first meal in Scottsdale was at Bacon--and interestingly enough bacon seemed to become the theme of our entire trip. Bacon chocolate chip cookies, bacon brittle, bacon-infused vodka, and bacon Bloody Mary's? They're all available somewhere in Scottsdale, but you can find the famous Bacon Bloody Mary here at Bacon.\n\nThis is a cool space for a breakfast spot, with indoor-outdoor seating and lots of light. Our server, who seemed to be a bit overworked since he was the only waiter, was very friendly and welcoming. We immediately ordered the famous Bacon Bloody Mary, a savory delight with its bacon garnish. We also split the Candied Bacon Flight, a delicious exploration of various bacon types. Despite him being the only one, our server was remarkably friendly and efficient. Everything was fantastic; the food was fresh and truly celebrated bacon. This spot was the perfect start to our trip. Highly recommend stopping here!",
        "It was my first time in Vegas and I went with my friend John, now John is a Vegas junkie. Seriously, he usually travels out there in November and March every year, absolutely loving hitting the Strip during March Madness. Anyway, he had found a couple of incredible deals at his travel agent, and bless his heart, he booked us two different experiences! One was at Treasure Island, and that deal even included airfare, which was fantastic. The other, however, was mind-blowing: two days and three nights at The Stratosphere, completely free! And as if that wasn't enough, when we checked in, they gave us $100 in free slot play, $50 bucks cash, AND a free buffet. Talk about hitting the jackpot before even touching a machine! It was an unforgettable introduction to the Vegas scene, thanks to John's savvy deal-hunting. Definitely an experience I'd love to repeat!",
        "I visited with my family for an early dinner on Saturday and was very impressed. We were the only ones there so early, and only one other guest arrived while we were eating, so I would say that reservations are not necessary until later in the evening.\n\nWe started with a platter of three hummuses - sun-dried tomato, kalamata olive, and black bean, accompanied with triangles of pita and some fresh veggies. The sun-dried tomato hummus was by far our favorite, but the others were delicious as well. Each had a distinct flavor, and the warm pita was perfect for scooping. For our main courses, I enjoyed the grilled chicken souvlaki \u2013 tender, perfectly seasoned, and served with fluffy rice and a crisp Greek salad. My husband\u2019s lamb shank was fall-off-the-bone tender in a rich, savory sauce. The kids were happy with their simple but well-prepared chicken tenders and fries. Service was attentive without being overbearing, and our server was very knowledgeable. The restaurant itself was clean and inviting. We had a wonderful experience and will definitely be back!",
        "I just had the absolute worst experience checking in. I've been here for 10 minutes and I'm already leaving this review, which I've never done before. Juaquine Lopes at the front desk should be terminated. After waiting in one line for 15 minutes to check in, he opens up a second line telling everyone behind us to go in front of us. I waited another 25 minutes to check in, only to be told by him that I was in the wrong line to begin with and its my fault (every other person in my line was there to check in as well, clearly designated for new arrivals). His sheer incompetence and appalling customer service are beyond belief. He condescendingly blamed me for a system he himself mismanaged, then refused to help, directing me to *another* line. This is an absolute disgrace. I've wasted nearly an hour of my precious time due to one individual's gross negligence. Management needs to seriously re-evaluate their staffing and training, starting with immediate disciplinary action against Juaquine. This level of unprofessionalism is unacceptable and has utterly ruined my first impression. Avoid this place if Juaquine is working.",
        "Went to this location this morning because we found some extra cash in the car before work, never will I ever stop at this location AGAIN.. Or for Mcdonalds for that matter. My partner and I walked into the establishment & each ordered a meal to eat inside. We went to go get our refreshments, as we were waiting 3 of the employees were staring at us then would look back at each other and laugh. As our food was called my partner went to go get it. I watched the 3 younger Hispanic guys watch my partner reach for the trey and yet again started laughing. The blatant disrespect was appalling. We felt completely unwelcome and uncomfortable. Our food was lukewarm and poorly assembled \u2013 soggy fries, a cold burger. We ate as quickly as possible, utterly disgusted by their unprofessionalism and what felt like discriminatory behavior. This was beyond bad service; it was a hostile environment. We will never return to this McDonald's, or frankly, any McDonald's again. Save yourself the humiliation.",
        "So, I have never actually taken the time to sit down and put pen to paper or even a single finger to keyboard for a review. Really, what I'm saying is, I'm pretty lazy, so for me to even write a review, means you should probably heed my statements... or not, it's sort of a free country (still)...\n\nMy wife and I went to \"Down Under\" a few nights ago because, a friend of ours had high recommendations. We walked in, sat where we wanted and were handed two menus, a wine list, and a specials board was pointed out. Our waiter, Liam, was incredibly friendly and gave excellent recommendations. We started with the surprisingly tender kangaroo sliders. My barramundi main was perfectly cooked, and my wife raved about her lamb chops. Portions were generous, everything fresh. The \"Down Under\" theme was subtle, creating a relaxed, inviting atmosphere. Our friend was spot on; this place is a hidden gem. We'll definitely be back for more Aussie delights. Highly recommended!",
        "Okay, I came to this place a lot for karaoke last year. It was fun cause I could take off my shirt and stuff and no one cared. They also had bar bingo which was a sure fire way to get drunk for under $15. Recently, a lot of friends were raving about the pizza, which I have had a few times before. I remember it being what I call \"bar pizza\". Pizza that is doey and fluffy, tastes good when you are sober but even better when you are drunk, however at the end of the night, you kinda feel like you\u2019ve eaten a whole loaf of bread. It\u2019s definitely not gourmet, but it serves its purpose perfectly \u2013 soaking up those cheap bingo beers. I mean, who needs fine dining when you can belt out power ballads shirtless and then carb-load for under twenty bucks? This spot is a guaranteed good time if you're not taking yourself too seriously.",
        "Claim Jumper continues to be my all-round favourite restaurant in the US. The very first time I dined at one in California, I was completely blown away \u2013 not just by the incredible taste of the food, but by the sheer generosity of the portion sizes! I vividly remember them even serving apples on the plates, which just emphasized how huge everything was. Their prime rib is absolutely divine, consistently cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. My second favorite, though, has to be their rotisserie chicken, especially when paired with their fantastic barbecue sauce. Honestly, if you order any steak there, do yourself a favor and get a side of that BBQ sauce to slather on; it's truly wonderful. Beyond these standouts, Claim Jumper boasts a wonderfully varied menu, ensuring there's something for everyone. The giant portions always deliver fantastic value for a reasonable price, and the quality is consistently excellent. It's a must-visit for a satisfying meal!",
        "Stopped in here on Saturday with G money. The host was pretty cool in finding us a table around the bar so we didn't have to go up and down any steps. Our server, Alysha (sp?) was one of the best servers I think I've ever had. If you've ever been to Applebees before you know the menu is pretty standard, but with a few cool dishes thrown in. The drink menu also has some nice looking selections on it. I'm not totally crazy about fruity drinks but the red apple sangria looked and sounded good. If I hadn't been driving, I definitely would've ordered that sangria. Next time for sure!\n\nFor food, I went with the Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp, and G money got the Fiesta Lime Chicken. Both were cooked perfectly and arrived quickly, even though the place was buzzing. Alysha continued to impress, checking on us frequently without being intrusive. Her genuine attentiveness truly elevated the whole dining experience. This particular Applebee's location really delivered, proving that excellent service can make all the difference. We left feeling full and happy. Definitely a solid choice for a casual, enjoyable meal!",
        "I've shopped here for years, but had a recent bad experience. Planning a party and ordering the food should not be such a hostile experience. Their ad clearly states they can have food ready for catering in 2 days, so I showed up to place my order over a week before the event \u2013 a full nine days prior. After waiting a considerable amount of time, I was finally greeted by an employee named Emily. It was 1:30 PM, and she seemed visibly upset that her lunch had been interrupted. I immediately apologized for taking her away from her meal, but her demeanor remained incredibly unwelcoming. She made us wait even longer while she grudgingly finished something before even acknowledging our presence properly. This level of unprofessionalism and clear disdain for a customer, especially when I was trying to place a significant catering order, was truly shocking. Given this experience, I'm seriously reconsidering if I'll ever return for my party needs or even regular shopping. It's disappointing when a long-standing relationship is soured by one incredibly poor interaction.",
        "For those of you who only read partial reviews--this review is about Guitar Center as a COMPANY and not this individual location. I admit that outright. I usually give 4s and 5s. I'm one of those people who has positive things to say about just about anywhere...but not here. Don't get me wrong--I have no problem with this individual location. I have been trying to order something site-to-store from the parent company website for three days. First, they advertised it as one price but as soon as it went into my cart it magically jumped up in price. I tried contacting customer service through their website and phone lines, but after being on hold for an absurd amount of time, I was disconnected both times. This happened not once, but repeatedly over three days of trying to place a simple site-to-store order. It's truly baffling how difficult they make it to spend money with them. For a company that caters to musicians, their off-key customer service and online experience are a major letdown. I'll take my business elsewhere for now.",
        "Beware Tourist Trap! 5th time in Vegas and this place so far has been the worst experience in service & food quality!\n\n1st star off: Unatentive \"Pretty Princess\" Waitress ( other reviewers seemed to have problems with the staff ), the \"busboy\" had a better attitude and was 10 times more attentive than her. Our waitress was distracted, barely checking on us. The busboy, contrastingly, was prompt, refilling drinks and clearing plates.\n\n2nd star off: Do yourself a favor and save your money and don't order any of their \"signature\" 30+ dollars drink ( the daiquiris were shockingly weak and tasted like watered-down syrup. At that price, you expect quality, not a glorified slushy.\n\nThe food was equally disappointing \u2013 overpriced, cold, and clearly mass-produced. This establishment relies on its Strip location to fleece tourists. Vegas has so many better dining experiences. Save your money and go elsewhere!",
        "The best buffet in town! We paid $34/person, kinda pricey... at least compared to all the other buffet in town, but it's definitely worth the money. And kids 12 and under pay half ($17), whereas other buffet places, such as Bellagio, you have to pay full price for kids.\n\nThe food selections are great... not too overwhelming like some other places where it has all kinds of dishes for all types of cuisines, but most of them you won't even bother to touch or try anyway. This place has enough selections of **high-quality, well-prepared dishes that cater to various tastes without making you feel overwhelmed. The focus here is clearly on quality over sheer quantity, and it shows. From the succulent prime rib at the carving station to the fresh seafood options and a delightful array of desserts, every dish feels intentionally crafted and delicious. I particularly appreciated the fresh salad bar and the perfectly cooked hot dishes. The service was also attentive, keeping tables clean and drinks refilled. It truly offers a premium dining experience that justifies the price, especially with the fantastic kids' discount. Highly recommend for a satisfying and enjoyable meal!**",
        "CHEAP! STINGY! MISERABLE!\n\nAfter all day of walking around on the Strip, I was starved. We found Fleur by chance as we explored Mandalay Bay. My BF wasn't very hungry, so he chose something from the \"small plate\" section of the menu, which, as it was explained to us, was similar to Tapas style. Since I was very hungry, I ordered \"slow cooked salmon\" from the \"large plate\" section of the menu. When the orders arrived, I was utterly shocked at the disparity.\n\nMy \"large plate\" salmon consisted of two tiny, postage-stamp-sized pieces, barely a mouthful each, sitting forlornly on a vast plate. It looked more like an amuse-bouche than an entree. Meanwhile, my boyfriend's \"small plate\" arrived looking like a full-sized meal \u2013 significantly more substantial than my supposed \"large plate.\" The portions were completely reversed and made absolutely no sense given the menu descriptions and especially the price difference. I paid \"large plate\" money for an appetizer. I left feeling completely ripped off and still hungry. Save your money and your appetite; there are better options in Vegas.",
        "When your tennis instructor has you and 8 others hitting balls for 2-and-a-half-hours in the 105 degree heat at Freedom Park, the last thing I wanted was a greasy burger or stir fry, or pizza. My body was craving hydration and something fresh and cold.\n\nInstead of our usual apres-tennis East Boulevard lunch haunts, my husband and I checked out Something Classic Cafe. (Home of the gourmet TV dinner which I will get to in a moment.)\n\nI got the salad trio with the chicken **salad (creamy, perfectly seasoned chunks of white meat), the fresh fruit salad, and the delightful pesto pasta salad.** My husband, still recovering from the heat, opted for their **turkey and avocado sandwich on a croissant, which was piled high and incredibly satisfying.** Everything felt light, refreshing, and exactly what we needed to cool down and refuel.\n\nAnd yes, about those gourmet TV dinners! They have a freezer full of pre-made, high-quality meals like beef bourguignon or salmon with roasted vegetables, packaged like a modern, upscale TV dinner. We grabbed a few for later in the week \u2013 genius concept for busy nights! Something Classic Cafe is now our go-to for healthy, delicious post-tennis recovery. Highly recommend!",
        "Unlike others, I did not find the owner friendly. In fact, my experience was quite the opposite; I found his demeanor to be incredibly rude and frankly, deeply insulting. I brought in my road bike for a repair that I would consider of moderate difficulty for any competent bike shop. Instead of attempting the repair, or even politely declining if it was beyond their scope, the owner chose to insult me directly. He told me I should sell my bike and get something more \"appropriate\" for someone of my \"physique.\"\n\nAt the moment I'm a little overweight, but here's the facts: every summer I road bike extensively, covering hundreds of miles, and my bike is perfectly suited for me and my riding habits. To be met with such a personal and unprofessional attack, rather than a service, was shocking. I suppose this place might be okay for average bikes needing average repairs, but if you have anything beyond that, or expect common courtesy, I'd strongly advise looking elsewhere. This was a truly demeaning encounter.",
        "Do you love a good waffle? Yes. Then Waffles incaffeinated is for you. Not a huge waffle fan? Enjoy a more savory breakfast? Then Waffles Incaffeinated is for you too! This menu has something for everyone. The girls and I recently headed down to Waffles INC for our monthly brunch on a beautiful Saturday morning in the burgh. Southside was just starting to become busy as people slowly awoke from their alcohol induced slumber and meandered outside to start their day. For those of you who were never SS residents, it was 11 AM, prime time for a hearty meal. We were promptly seated and our server was incredibly friendly and attentive. The menu truly lives up to its promise, offering an impressive array of sweet and savory options. I opted for the \"Chicken & Waffles\" with a hint of spice \u2013 absolute perfection, crispy and satisfying. My friends raved about their \"Nutella Dream\" waffle and the \"Breakfast Burrito.\" The coffee was strong and plentiful. Waffles Incaffeinated is a definite must-visit for anyone craving delicious breakfast or brunch in the 'Burgh!",
        "OMG... I was in food heaven! :) My friend and I decided to give this place a try because we were hearing such good things about it and about their vegan options. So this what we ordered and shared:\n\n1st dish: Tofu and Soy Chorizo burrito...oh man, this was awesome. The burrito was perfectly spiced and tasty. I'm sure any non-vegan would have never guessed it was vegan; it was that good! The chorizo was da bomb! The dish even came with tofu scramble on the side, adding great texture.\n\n2nd dish: The Breakfast Crunchwrap. Wow! The potatoes, the tofu scramble, the cheese\u2026 everything was just perfect. The crunchwrap was indeed crunchy and yummy, totally living up to its name. We were so impressed by the creativity and execution of these vegan dishes. This spot is definitely a new favorite, and we can't wait to go back and try more. Highly recommend!",
        "This was one of the few places we found open on Christmas day and we went for dinner. Even though the place was packed and there was a line out the door, we were seated in less than 10 minutes and the service was excellent. Having lived in New Mexico for about 5 years, I've learned a lot about green chile. I've also learned that more often than not, when you visit a restaurant serving green chile outside of New Mexico, their idea of \"hot\" is what we would call less than mild in NM. So, I was skeptical when I ordered their \"hot\" green chile. To my delight, it had a fantastic, authentic flavor with a real, building heat! Not NM \"five-alarm,\" but far from bland. The entire meal, from the tender pork to the perfect sides, was delicious. This place truly understands good New Mexican food. Given the Christmas rush, their quality and efficiency were remarkable. A new favorite; we'll definitely be back!",
        "This was my second time at the Trump and I am please again. I appreciate that this hotel is simply a hotel and not a casino.... My stay was quiet, smoke-free, and restful. The prices are so reasonable! The walk from valet to the lobby check-in to the elevator is accessible and not a journey through a casino or to the other side of the hotel. If you're ready to go out on the town and need a taxi, the bell boy will happily and quickly hail one for you immediately. \n\nThe rooms are amazing! Each is incredibly spacious, featuring a comfortable bed, a large bathroom with a separate tub and shower, and often a kitchenette. They are immaculate, beautifully appointed, and offer a true sense of luxury and calm. It\u2019s the perfect retreat after a busy day. This hotel consistently delivers on comfort and convenience, making it my top choice for future visits whenever I'm in town. A truly peaceful and upscale experience!",
        "This place is a real gem for those who like to geek out or are true history buffs (that would include my son and husband). We took a visit to Vegas with the family and really wanted to check this place out. We got in here with a Groupon which was $48 for the whole family (5 people) plus access to Area 51. What a fantastic deal for an afternoon of exploration!\n\nThere are two distinct areas in this exhibit: Area 51 and the National Atomic Testing Museum (NATM). Area 51 is a delightfully quirky dive into extraterrestrial life and aliens. It's filled with cheesy electronic sounds, a collection of alien dolls, and intriguing news articles. It's a fun, lighthearted take on the unknown, perfect for a bit of kitschy entertainment.\n\nThe NATM, however, is where the serious history buffs really get their fix. It offers a fascinating and educational look at America's atomic testing program, providing a thoughtful counterpoint to the alien antics. We spent a good amount of time here, absorbing the exhibits and learning about this significant piece of history. Combining the fun of Area 51 with the gravitas of the NATM makes for a unique and worthwhile stop in Vegas, especially if you snag a deal like we did!",
        "So... I don't live in Montreal but I relied on this grocery store to supply me with some breakfasts, lunches and snacks, while I was visiting from Boston. Not being from the area, I am not sure how well priced the groceries are here, but most things seemed pretty over-priced (at least compared to similar grocery stores in the Boston area). I was seriously in shock over the price of the M&Ms. Almost $5 for a small bag?! They have their own President's Choice brand, which was more reasonable than name brands and the items that I tried from that line were surprisingly good quality and offered better value. Their yogurt and bakery items were perfectly fine for a quick bite. Despite the overall high prices, the store's convenient location made it a necessary stop for daily essentials. It was clean and well-stocked, serving its purpose for a tourist needing quick provisions. Just be prepared for the sticker shock, especially on branded goods!",
        "My experience was poor. I was so excited to try this place after seeing and hearing so many good things. When I arrived the hostess was rude and pretended that I didn't exist until she realized that I wasn't going away. We were sat quite quickly, but it took nearly 15 minutes before our waiter came to take a drink order. I ordered one of their signature drinks and was pleased when it arrived. Our waiter brought out bread and herb butter, but the butter was nearly frozen and impossible to spread over the cold bread. I was a little taken back by the pricing on the entrees. I expected much more for the cost. The food itself was mediocre at best; my main course was bland and uninspired. The slow service continued throughout, making the entire meal a frustrating experience. This place completely failed to live up to its reputation or its high prices. I left feeling utterly ripped off and deeply disappointed.",
        "I want to start off saying that I love dogs! I have two of my own so of course when I found out that this was being built directly across from the school I work at, I was there for the grand opening and several times since. There are two gated areas, one for small dogs and one for big dogs. I have to go to the small dog one as I have 2 small dogs. I gave it 4 stars because there is always a shortage of waste bags when I go and it is a little smaller than I would have liked. My dogs don't seem to mind the size at all, as they're just thrilled to have a safe, dedicated space to run around and play with other small pups. The park itself is always very clean, and I appreciate that there are separate areas to keep the smaller dogs from being overwhelmed. It's truly a fantastic addition to the community, especially being so conveniently located. If they could consistently keep the waste bags stocked, it would easily be a five-star spot! It's still a wonderful place for my furry friends to burn off some energy.",
        "On our recent trip to Vegas from the New England, we were craving ramen. Having lived in Hawaii and Los Angeles, and frequenters of Ippudo in New York, you can consider us ramen fiends. FOOD - We ordered tonkotsu ramen and tonkotsu-shoyu ramen (it's NOT \"tonKATsu,\" people!), gyoza, kimchi fried rice, pork belly bowl, and mini mentaiko bowl. Yes, a lot of food for 3, but we certainly made a dent!\n\nThe tonkotsu ramen was incredibly rich and flavorful, with perfectly cooked noodles and tender chashu. The tonkotsu-shoyu offered a delightful variation, equally satisfying. And yes, for the love of all that is holy, it's TONKOTSU, not tonkatsu! The gyoza were crispy perfection, and the kimchi fried rice was a delicious, spicy accompaniment. Both the pork belly bowl and mini mentaiko bowl were excellent additions, showcasing their diverse menu. For serious ramen lovers, this spot is a must-visit in Vegas. It definitely hit the spot and exceeded our expectations for a Strip-adjacent ramen joint!",
        "The wait for a walk in was 2 hours. I just came in for an x-ray because my wisdom teeth were coming in. I figured it was going to be an easy visit, but then they talked me into extracting a tooth by saying it would only cost $93. I don't know, there are complications so that will be $165. I figured what the hell, I'm already here, I already waited, might as well go through with it... Bad idea. Keep in mind these are dental students, not actual dentists, so they really are not that experienced, especially when it came to the actual extraction and handling unexpected issues. The initial price jump was a red flag, but the pressure to proceed after such a long wait was immense. The entire process felt rushed and poorly managed, leading to a much more uncomfortable and painful experience than it should have been. I left feeling ripped off and in more pain than when I arrived. Definitely think twice before trusting complex procedures to students, especially when the pricing is so fluid.",
        "Reviewing just the casino. And that's quite enough. Researching my trip to death, a common theme was to check out \"the places where the locals go\". Promises of loose slots, friendlier dealers, food deals, lower table minimums, etc. Mrs. H. and I were just driving around, took the left off of LVB onto Sahara, and bumped into Palace Station. Me: \"Oh yeah!....,these are the joints I've been hearing about! These are the hidden gems!\"\n\nWe pulled in, found easy parking, and stepped inside. The atmosphere was immediately more relaxed than the Strip. We found plenty of open slots and yes, they did seem to pay out a bit more frequently \u2013 maybe it was just beginner's luck, but it felt less like a money pit. Dealers at the blackjack tables were genuinely pleasant and engaging, a refreshing change from the often-stoic Strip crews. Table minimums were indeed lower, making it much more approachable for casual play. We didn't try the food this time, but the various promotions advertised looked promising. Palace Station definitely delivered on the \"local\" vibe, offering a more laid-back, player-friendly experience away from the tourist crush. A solid alternative for a few hours of gaming.",
        "Want the absolute worst waxing experience ever? Go here. Seriously, I've NEVER had an experience like the one I had a few weeks ago.\n\nI went in on a Sunday morning and from the very first moment was barraged with three different people trying to get me to 1) realize I need to wax every three weeks or else and 2) should be signing up for a waxing package immediately. So I was already pretty turned off before I even got in the waxing room.\n\nBut then the real \"fun\" started. I was ushered into a cold, sterile room by a waxer who barely looked up from her phone. She haphazardly slapped on the wax, then yanked it off with a speed that made it excruciating. It felt like she was rushing through the whole thing. My skin was left red, inflamed, and still patchy with hair \u2013 a truly botched job! When I pointed it out, she just shrugged, offering no apology or solution. This place is a rip-off with horrendous service and zero regard for clients. Avoid at all costs!",
        "Best Buffet in Las Vegas. Period. My only real dislike about this place is the lack of truly good seafood choices. While the sushi was pretty fresh and the clams/mussels/shrimp bar was a neat and delicious idea, the trout salad, salty fishy crostini, and seared salmon were just alright. And as a huge crab-bie, the crab definitely left something to be desired. That was a bit of a letdown for me.\n\nAll that aside, everything else was pretty darn good for buffet food. They truly excel in other areas. The Tomato/Corn Risotto was wonderfully flavorful, the Angry Mac n' Cheese packed a fantastic kick, and the Lamb was cooked to perfection. Despite my seafood preferences not being fully met, the sheer quality and variety of their non-seafood dishes make this place a must-visit.",
        "We are staying at the MGM Grand for a conference and I wanted to have my first Thomas Keller experience. Unfortunately, maybe I should have waited until I could get to San Francisco or NYC. This restaurant is very difficult to find at the Venetian, which was frustrating. We arrived at 8:30 PM on Sunday night without a reservation and were seated right away, which was nice.\n\nHowever, the salad choices were quite disappointing. I was expecting more refined options; for instance, the chevre chaud was served on generic mixed greens instead of the expected mache, a missed opportunity. So, I opted for the endive and watercress with Roquefort. The dressing was good, though slightly too acidic for my taste. Overall, not the groundbreaking culinary introduction I had hoped for.",
        "Bought many items at Fry's electronics but never ever again. Worst experience ever regarding service and repair, hands down. I brought in a computer purchased less than two years ago, still under warranty, because its hard drive supposedly crashed. After an agonizing three weeks of supposed service and data transfer, my computer was returned as absolute trash. Windows 7 was completely corrupt, only a mere portion of my files were actually transferred, and to make matters worse, all the essential programs that came pre-installed and were the very reason I chose that specific model are now entirely gone. So, in addition to wasting $70 on their \"transfer service,\" I then had to shell out another $200 elsewhere just to get the machine functional and attempt to recover what they destroyed. This was a complete nightmare. Avoid their service department at all costs unless you enjoy throwing money away for a non-working product. Utterly disgusted with Fry's.",
        "What a disappointment! I went to Aureole Las Vegas for my sisters birthday dinner. I checked it out online and it sounded amazing. She said yes and so VEGAS HERE WE COME!! Saturday night our party of 8 get to what we thought would be a fabulous dinner. We are taken to our table and are rudely greeted by our waiter. He quickly tells us about their wines and walks away. We flag him down and ask for the sommelier. Our waiter comes back after several minutes and takes our drink order. Drinks were great but after that, it was an absolute nightmare. We waited an eternity for him to return to take our food order, and when he finally did, he was clearly annoyed by our questions. The food then took an unacceptably long time to arrive, and when it did, several dishes were cold or poorly executed for a restaurant of this supposed caliber. My sister\u2019s birthday, which we mentioned upon booking, went completely unacknowledged. The service was consistently dismissive and uncaring. For the exorbitant prices, we expected an unforgettable experience, not a forgettably bad one. Save your money and celebrate elsewhere. This place is all hype and no substance.",
        "Decided to run in here, because it's close, for a quick sushi dinner and afterwards, we wished we hadn't. They were NOT nice to us, it was like we were inconveniencing them, even though there were many many empty tables.\n\nSo... as we are talking with the hostess, working on being seated, some snooty chick comes up, interrupts and says, \"um, we need to be seated NOW\". The hostess then asks, \"Is your party all here?\" (a standard question she clearly resented). The snooty chick just rolled her eyes and said, \"YES.\" To our disbelief, the hostess immediately seated *her* party, leaving us standing for minutes, feeling invisible. When we were finally seated, it was at a tiny, cramped table despite many open ones. Our server was equally disinterested, practically tossing menus at us. The sushi itself was bland and overpriced, definitely not worth the hassle or appalling service. This place seems to operate on the premise that customers are a nuisance. Save your money and good mood; pick another sushi spot.",
        "Was in Vegas for the weekend for Punk Rock Bowling and wanted to check out the fight. I searched for somewhere showing the fight and came across this $10 UFC viewing party. My group decided to check it out and was very disappointed. For $10 you get to stand in a short line that takes forever because there are security guards frisking you and ruffling through your pockets and belongings. You then proceed to the ballroom where the seats are arranged in a clever circular octagon formation, facing several large screen projectors. It looked cool until you try to find a seat and **realize it's standing room only. The venue was oversold, with views constantly blocked by the crush of people. The audio was poor, making it hard to follow the commentary. This felt less like a viewing party and more like an overpriced, disorganized cattle call. Definitely not worth the $10; save your money and find a proper sports bar instead.**",
        "The Lost Dog Wash Trail and I (as well as Bry and our two labradors) had the pleasure of meeting each other at the end of April. Even at a little after 8am, there was a freak storm hovering nearby so we had some concerns with \"surviving\" the trail and getting back in time before getting fully rained on. To our relief, the hike was easy as pie and had little elevation gain, but we did encounter one small problem. We were talking and missed a turn and ended up adding another trail and a half or so to our loop. While initially frustrating, this unexpected detour actually led us to some more scenic viewpoints we wouldn't have otherwise seen! The trail itself is well-maintained, mostly gravel, and perfect for a leisurely stroll with furry friends. Despite our navigational blunder, the dogs loved splashing in the occasional puddles and sniffing every new scent. We eventually found our way back, just as the first drops of rain started to fall. Lost Dog Wash Trail is a fantastic option for an easy, dog-friendly outing, even if you add a few unplanned miles. Just pay better attention than we did!",
        "I didn't stay here, just visited opening weekend to see what it was like... And I was very underwhelmed. The broken elevators and the crowds, definitely expected that kind of thing for opening. There are growing pains.\n\nWhat I didn't expect was the layout and design of this place. It was perfectly \"meh.\" Being the first opening of a major resort and casino since I've moved here, I was excited to see what it would be like. I really didn't like the design, and left confused about how they could have created something so utterly bland and uninspired. For such a massive, highly anticipated project, the casino floor felt like a generic, confusing maze with no distinct personality or flow. There was no grandeur, no unique theme, just endless rows of machines and tables. Even the retail and dining areas felt like an afterthought, lacking the vibrant energy or upscale feel you'd expect. It's truly a missed opportunity; I was hoping for a game-changer, but instead, it felt like they just mailed it in.",
        "The ambiance is lovely and many of the dishes above average but the service was so terrible, it can guarantee you'll have a bad night....so why bother? Everything started off fine even though the wait for a table ended up not being the \"10 minutes\" they promised but well over 30 minutes. They sit you down and get your order and everything seems fine. And then you wait. Over 45 minutes later, without a peep from our waitress to check in and let us know what is going, food was dumped on our table. No apology or explanation was offered; it was clear our table was an afterthought. The food, when it finally arrived, was decent, but the entire experience was marred by the neglect. It's a shame, because the potential is there, but until they sort out their front-of-house, I won't be returning. It's not worth the frustration.",
        "I won't write much here, as I don't really do franchise reviews...and, actually, I've already written a review for another Sprouts location (or two? I don't remember and can't be bothered to check...). So, if you want a better run down on Sprouts, in my eyes, having shopped there for almost 5 years, please check my profile. For now, this is a quick run down of this location.\n\nOn the downside, some of their stock is different than what we'd grown accustomed to in Salt Lake City. This particular store, while clean and well-organized, sometimes lacks the specific local or regional items we found essential. However, the produce section remains consistently fresh and vibrant, a hallmark of Sprouts. The staff here are generally friendly and helpful, making the shopping experience pleasant despite the occasional item hunt. Parking is ample, which is always a plus. Overall, it's a solid Sprouts, just be prepared for slight variations if you're used to another branch.",
        "Whoever goes to this place is out of their mind. Depended on Yelp for reviews, and supposedly they do a great job. Spent 300 the nightbefore for a beautiful ombre and decided to go in for a quick small trim to freshen up my hair. Well, now my hair is in a bun because it looks horrible. money down the drain for the next few weeks until i go and have to spend another 300 for a new ombre since half of mine was cut off. The girl cutting my hair was a really nice girl, but when i called to speak to a manager, I was met with complete indifference. She basically told me 'trims happen' and offered no real apology or solution. Unhappy is an understatement! My beautiful, expensive ombre is ruined. What was supposed to be a quick touch-up turned into a nightmare. I left feeling completely dismissed and furious. The lack of accountability and customer service is appalling. Save your money and your hair \u2013 do NOT come here. Absolutely infuriating.",
        "I went here tonight with the BF. We thought it was really meh, capital MEH. We had a reservation, but for some reason got sat inside. There were virtually no people eating inside and outside was lively and had a band playing... we couldn't even hear it inside... it was like silent. I would think they would at least open the doors, but nope. So that was a bad start. It took our waitress a long time to even come to our table, and when she came she asked if we wanted drinks and apps (which we didn't given the already sour mood and her tardiness). We just wanted to order our mains and escape.\n\nThe food mirrored the ambiance: utterly uninspired. My burger was dry, his pasta bland, tasting straight from a box. Getting water refills felt like an Olympic sport. We spent the whole time wishing we were outside, missing out on the fun. It was a complete waste of our evening and money. Skip this place; find somewhere with actual atmosphere and attentive service.",
        "Sadly in the year and a half since I first wrote my review things have changed a bit at Cafe, and not for the best. More and more my coworkers and I are experiencing regular problems with this place, that is when we're brave enough to risk ordering from Cafe now. Firstly, there's the problems with the orders. It honestly doesn't seem to matter if we order right off the menu or if we ask for a small change to our order - something basic will always be missing (like lettuce) or done incorrectly when the food arrives.\n\nSecondly, the food quality itself has noticeably slipped. Items often arrive cold or soggy, a far cry from the fresh, hot meals we used to enjoy. And when we try to call to rectify these issues, the customer service is often unhelpful, bordering on dismissive. It's truly disappointing to see a place that was once a go-to for our office lunch become such a consistent source of frustration. We're now actively looking for new options, as Cafe no longer provides the reliable, quality experience it once did.",
        "Probably should give this one star, but can't bring myself to go that low.\n\nOn the plus side, this buffet is huge, well-laid out for easy maneuvering, and always fully stocked \u2013 never an empty tray. The staff were super friendly, very prompt with clearing plates, and quick to refill drinks. Service and logistics were genuinely excellent.\n\nHowever, the major drawback is the food. The majority was simply disappointing. Sushi rolls were overloaded with imitation crab slaw; every piece had a healthy, gloopy dollop, completely overwhelming any other flavors. Beyond that, most hot dishes were bland, greasy, or had unappealing textures. Fried items tasted old, and even basics like lo mein lacked seasoning. It truly felt like quantity over quality, making the overall eating experience consistently subpar. Despite the good service, the food just failed.",
        "DO NOT HIRE THiS GUY!!!!!! This guy is an incompetent attorney. I was arrested for DUI in November of 2012 for being in proximity of my vehicle. The Charge was reduced to reckless driving due to lack of evidence. It should have been thrown out but I live in Arizona and didn't want to travel back and forth for a trial. In July of 2013 when he went to court he forgot to take my signed plea to court. No big deal, the trial was rescheduled for two weeks later. The judge orders me to take an online DUI school. A week later, he called to say he forgot to file the plea AGAIN! This pattern of negligence continued. I constantly had to chase him for updates, as his communication was non-existent. This attorney's complete lack of professionalism and organizational skills cost me endless stress and wasted money. Find competent representation elsewhere. You deserve better.",
        "I had been wanting to try this place for some time, knowing that it was esteemed chef Tom Colicchio's restaurant, and the experience was divine. The ambiance was very simplistic, not extravagant, but at the same time very elegant. Our service was excellent as well; the server was helpful with picking out a wine (I think the cheapest wine on the menu was about $44 so be prepared to spend some $$ if you plan on drinking).\n\nThe food itself was fantastic. My only complaint was that our server did not make it clear whatsoever that the portions are tasting-menu-sized, not traditional entree-sized. We ended up ordering an appetizer, two main courses, and a side dish, thinking it would be a substantial meal for two, but found ourselves still a little hungry. While the quality was impeccable, we would have ordered more if we had known this upfront. Despite this minor miscommunication, the overall experience was truly memorable. The flavors were complex and innovative, a testament to Colicchio's reputation. I highly recommend this establishment for a special occasion, just be sure to ask about portion sizes or be prepared to order several plates to share!",
        "EKKKKKK! Are You Kidding ME? This Sam Woo restaurant location is RIDICULOUS! Disgusting food for a ridiculous price! 90 DOLLARS for SIX DISHES!\n\nCame here for lunch before leaving Vegas - and obviously not a good one at all.\n\nWe were a party of 6 adults and 2 children - we ordered 6 dishes:\n\nHouse Steamed Chicken with the ginger onion dipping sauce - there were barely any meat on the chicken - quite frankly it was nearly all bones and what little meat was there, was dry and stringy. The ginger onion sauce was the only decent part, but couldn't salvage the pathetic portion. We also ordered the Braised E-Fu Noodles, swimming in a watery, bland sauce, lacking flavor depth. Noodles were overcooked and mushy. Salt and Pepper Pork Chops were small, greasy, and tasted stale. Even the stir-fried gai lan was limp and flavorless. Every dish profoundly disappointed. For $90, an absolute rip-off. This was supposed to be a nice last meal, and it utterly ruined our Vegas farewell. Avoid this Sam Woo location at all costs!",
        "I don't understand any decent review for this place. We met 4 other couples and this was a disaster from the beginning. First of all the decor is hideous. Its in a strip mall and the furniture was old and dark. The tables wobbled and you could not walk on the old worn out vinyl floor without your feet sticking to the ground. They act as if this is an upscale place (based upon the menu and the prices), however nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nDrinks...I ordered a captain and diet and it tasted like club soda. Clearly, they are watering down their drinks. Other cocktails were equally weak. The food was no better; my \"gourmet\" burger was dry and bland, served with cold fries. Service was slow, indifferent, and completely unapologetic. This place is a complete rip-off, falsely presenting itself as anything but a dive. Save your money and avoid this abysmal experience.",
        "Let me start off by saying I did not choose to have this company attempt to fix my clothes dryer.....they were contracted by my home warranty.\n\nMy trouble started last December. On 12/19/11, my dryer broke. My warranty company contracted Avalon for the repair. On the 23rd, when I still hadn't heard anything from them, I called their office. I was informed they never received any notification from the warranty company, which immediately felt like a runaround. After going back and forth for a couple of frustrating hours, they finally scheduled a service appointment for the 28th! This meant I had to take an entire day off work, wasting precious vacation time for what should have been a straightforward repair. The lack of communication and the sheer inconvenience of their process was appalling. It's clear they have significant issues with their internal communication or their scheduling practices. I wouldn't recommend them based on this initial, incredibly frustrating experience. Avoid if you can!",
        "I've driven past this place many times and always made a mental note to try it out. I had a sushi craving today and thought why the hell not?\n\nThe good: I walked in and was impressed by the decor. It was warm and inviting and the hostess was nice.\n\nAnd that's where it ends.\n\nThe bad: I was seated and sat there for a good five minutes before I was even approached by a server to take my drink order. 3 of them walked right past me multiple times. And there were only a handful of other tables occupied, making the lack of service baffling. When my server finally arrived, there was no apology, just a curt \"What can I get you?\". The sushi I ordered was bland, the rice overcooked, and the fish certainly lacked freshness. It felt like an afterthought. Getting the check was another lengthy wait. Despite the nice ambiance, the service and food quality were incredibly disappointing. I won't be returning.",
        "Am a little late on this update as it's about our Fathers Day Brunch experience and that was a few weeks ago but, still felt compelled to type. Went to brunch with my wife, her sister, and their parents. The brunch menu was pretty extensive and covered an App, Entree and Dessert for $35.\n\nFirst good news. Not being a dessert person, I asked if I could sub two apps instead of one app and one dessert. \"It's fathers day sir, absolutely no problem\".\n\nSecond good news. Just as we were settling in, our server was incredibly attentive without being overbearing. The food itself was exceptional. For appetizers, the crab cakes were perfectly seared, and the avocado toast (my second app!) was fresh and vibrant. Everyone's entrees, from the classic eggs benedict to the pan-seared salmon, arrived hot and beautifully presented. The quality for the $35 price point was truly outstanding, especially considering the generous portions. Even my in-laws, who can be particular, raved about their meals. The atmosphere was lively but not too loud, making for a perfect family gathering. This spot truly made our Father's Day memorable with delicious food and top-notch service. We'll definitely be back, no matter the occasion!",
        "When we got here there was a lot of people waiting and we checked in and sat down within 15 minutes. Not bad for a full restaraunt. Once we were seated are very attentive waitress Mary came and it was like 'BANG BANG BANG' Seriously. She was good! She got our drinks, took our orders, got a banana nut muffins and about 10 minutes or less later, our food was out at our table. How awesome was that? They are really organized or the cooks are secretly Superman or have some sort of secret powers. Our food, my perfectly cooked omelet and my friend's fluffy pancakes, arrived hot and tasted incredibly fresh. Mary checked back just enough, ensuring we had everything needed without hovering. The whole experience, from the quick seating to the lightning-fast service and delicious food, made for a fantastic brunch. This place clearly has their system down pat, even when slammed. We left feeling completely satisfied and impressed. Highly recommend for a great meal!",
        "What up, Big Dog!? \\n\\nI'll tell you what's up, this place is my IDEAL coffee shop. Literally. Figuratively. In my dreams. In Pittsburgh. In my Pittsburgh dreams. \\n\\nWhy, you ask? \\n\\nWell, I'll list out the what's what: \\n\\n*A customizable OATMEAL BAR. Yes!

A perfect alternative to pastries and sugary treats, What up, Big Dog!?\n\nI'll tell you what's up, this place is my IDEAL coffee shop. Literally. Figuratively. In my dreams. In Pittsburgh. In my Pittsburgh dreams.\n\nWhy, you ask?\n\nWell, I'll list out the what's what:\n\n*A customizable OATMEAL BAR. Yes! Oatmeal with all the fixins: brown sugar, walnuts, chocolate chips, dried fruit and more....! A perfect alternative to pastries and sugary treats, it\u2019s a healthy game-changer. But the coffee itself? Stellar. Their lattes are consistently smooth, perfectly brewed, and the baristas clearly know their craft \u2013 pure coffee bliss. Beyond the amazing drinks and that incredible oatmeal, the atmosphere is exactly what I crave: cozy, bright, with comfortable seating and a gentle buzz. It\u2019s ideal for working, relaxing, or catching up. The staff are incredibly welcoming and efficient, making every visit a pleasure. This place truly nails the coffee shop experience. My Pittsburgh dreams are now a reality!",
        "This review is strictly for purchase of a Christmas tree.\n\nI was pretty set on getting our tree from another store because it was a steal but they had run out and my heart was sad. So me and my family were on a mission to find our perfect Christmas tree, without spending a fortune on doing so.\n\nFor whatever reason, I thought I was going to be stuck shopping at a Christmas tree lot to get our tree. It never crossed my mind to come to a Nursery to get a Christmas tree but when we found out my sister in law got hers from a local nursery, it was a total revelation!\n\nStepping onto their lot, the fresh pine scent was amazing. They had an impressive selection of vibrant, healthy Fraser and Noble firs. I expected high prices, but was pleasantly surprised; their trees were competitively priced, often better than temporary lots. We found a perfect 7-foot Noble fir within budget. Staff was efficient and friendly. We're thrilled with our purchase, and our home smells amazing. This nursery is now our definite go-to!",
        "I usually try to write only positive reviews of places or companies, but lately I've come across one too many bad doctors in this valley and fed up, felt compelled to describe my experience here at PHG. Unfortunately, it differs greatly then that of most of the other reviews. It is those other reviews that convinced me to try this place. I guess not everything works for everyone, but I wanted to share my personal experience. Completely unimpressed with this place and Dr. Majidi. From the dingy exterior of the building to the unwelcoming, outdated waiting room, the entire atmosphere felt off. The front desk staff were curt and seemed annoyed, barely making eye contact. My appointment was significantly delayed, and Dr. Majidi himself was rushed and dismissive. He barely listened, cutting me off and trivializing my concerns. No warmth or empathy, just a quick, perfunctory consultation that left me unheard and frustrated. A truly disappointing experience; I will not be returning.",
        "This store automatically gets only one star because the worst sales associate I have ever come across has transferred from the CL store at the Palazzo to this one. I don't know her name but she's a tall, older lady with short dark hair and a European accent who has a scowl on her face at all times. She's not knowledgeable, helpful, or friendly at all and makes me feel extremely uncomfortable. Who wants to get the death stare while they are shopping or even shopping at ANOTHER store right across the way (which she has done to me multiple times)? Her presence alone is enough to deter me from entering, let alone making a purchase. It's truly baffling how someone with such an openly hostile demeanor can be employed in customer service, especially in a luxury retail environment. Her consistent negative attitude ruins the entire experience. Management needs to address this serious issue. It's a shame, as the products are lovely, but I can't justify patronizing a business where I feel so unwelcome.",
        "Unusual for a Vietnamese restaurant, I hold this place to the same standard of cleanliness I expect from a Chinese restaurant: if it tastes good and doesn't make me sick, it's a-okay! I have grown up in Asian restaurants and really, despite all the negative reviews, this place isn't that scary! If you're looking for ambiance, well, maybe you should save this one for another day. I can't say I've ever been to a Vietnamese restaurant where the decorations blew me away. However, if you are craving some mighty decent Vietnamese cuisine, you **will find it here.** Their pho broth is consistently deep and aromatic, a true comfort. The grilled pork vermicelli bowls are equally fantastic, with perfectly charred meat and fresh ingredients. Forget the frills; this is where you come for a genuinely delicious, hearty meal without pretense. It's the kind of place that reminds you why you love Vietnamese food in the first place, proving that substance truly triumphs over style every time.",
        "for everyone who says this place is amazing, they must be blind to true culinary technique. ok so first thing I noticed was the drab wait staff. very boring and didn't even sound excited to be at work. on another note, the menu is written well but the food did not deliver. i wanted to try the fried deviled eggs, and they were clearly warmed up in the microwave and dry. the homemade spicy aioli, was nothing more than sriracha and mayo. i understand what aioli, but is wasn't mixed well or something. then, my main course, the 'smoked brisket tacos,' were utterly disappointing. The brisket was bland, dry, and lacked any real depth of flavor you'd expect from something 'smoked.' The tortillas were stale, and the pico de gallo watery. For the price, I felt utterly ripped off. This place is a masterclass in how to underwhelm. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.",
        "March of last year, the BF and I were in the midst of a cross country move - all the way from Chapel Hill, NC to LA. The BF was especially sad as he was leaving his NC climbing crew of 7 years behind. So what better way to get together with some of his climbing friends who had also moved out west of the Mississippi? Meet up at the Red Rock Rendezvous!\n\nA weekend of climbing clinics, swag, and events sponsered by Mountain Gear to raise cash for the Access Fund... we quickly realized it was 80% socializing and 20% actual climbing. And honestly, it was exactly what we needed! The atmosphere was electric, filled with climbers from all walks of life, sharing stories, beta, and laughter. Seeing the BF light up, surrounded by old friends and making new ones, was truly priceless. We did manage to squeeze in a couple of clinics, picking up some valuable tips, but the real highlight was the sheer joy of community. Mountain Gear did an incredible job orchestrating an event that truly brought people together, all while supporting the crucial work of the Access Fund. It was the perfect balm for our moving-induced stress and a fantastic welcome to the Western climbing scene. Highly recommend for any climber looking for good vibes and great company!",
        "I am shocked that I am barely writing this review for Wildflower Bread Company since I eat here at least twice a week. I used to be obsessed with Paradise Bakery but then I met Wildflower and so I dumped them. The reason? Their ingredients! So fresh, so delicious! I've literally had everything on their menu and there is nothing that I wouldn't recommend. Isn't that hard to admit when it's not your mom's food you are having? Well anyways, another thing I love about Wildflower is that they are always giving back to the community. A few months ago, they partnered with a local food bank, donating unsold bread and pastries daily. It's truly heartwarming to see a business not just focused on profit, but on making a real difference. Beyond their incredible food and altruism, the staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is wonderfully inviting. Whether it's a quick coffee and pastry or a full lunch, Wildflower never disappoints. Seriously, if you haven't been, you're missing out on a true local gem. Highly recommend!",
        "I have never had Dim Sum until this weekend....it was a totally new experience for me. I met up with some local friends in Vegas, as I was in town primarily to party, and they suggested we hit up Chang's for lunch. They patiently walked me through the concept, but thankfully took charge of the ordering, claiming I'd probably pick some \"weird stuff\" for my virgin voyage.\n\nNow, I don't remember the names of anything we ate, but it was all incredible! There were these delicate steamed dumplings, some filled with savory shrimp, others with what I think was pork \u2013 absolutely bursting with flavor. We also had crispy fried rolls, which were perfectly golden and delicious. Then there was a dish with tender, glistening noodles, and even something sweet, almost like a fluffy bun with a creamy filling. Chang's truly blew my mind, and my friends were right to guide me. What an amazing culinary adventure! I'm officially a Dim Sum convert.",
        "I would consider myself a Whole Foods Market super fan from Michigan to North Carolina to Arizona. They are generally where I find foods I love and the primary destination for my \"healthy\" shopping. I usually only venture to other grocery stores when I absolutely can't find what I need at a Whole Foods. This Chandler location certainly reinforces my loyalty.\n\nThe selection of bulk dry items here is consistently excellent, offering a fantastic variety for pantry staples. I always appreciate how fresh and vibrant their veggies and fruits are \u2013 truly the best quality around, making healthy eating a breeze. I also make sure to stock up on their extensive range of spices for all my cooking endeavors. Furthermore, the store itself, along with the shopping baskets, are always immaculately clean, which contributes to a very pleasant and hygienic shopping experience. While these qualities are generally true for Whole Foods, I've noticed that only for the Chandler location, the staff go above and beyond with their helpfulness and knowledge, making every visit exceptionally smooth and enjoyable. It's a truly reliable spot for premium groceries!",
        "I'm not one to overindulge, but when I am desirous for an adult beverage, I want the best. It was a gift for a colleague that led me back to the spirits purveyor, that until now, was always a pleasure to visit. Far from expert in my knowledge of Canadian whiskey, I was hoping an experienced staff member of this shop might help me select the best. Unfortunately, the feeling I got was akin to interrupting a brain surgeon at work\u2014although this one was operating on cardboard with a box cutter. Brusque and utterly uninterested, the employee barely looked up, offering only a curt, unhelpful suggestion before returning to their task. There was zero effort to understand my needs or my colleague's preferences. This once reliable establishment, usually a beacon of knowledgeable service, truly disappointed me. While the selection remains impressive, the lack of customer care was stark. I ended up picking a bottle at random, feeling unwelcome. My next purchase will likely be elsewhere.",
        "I read some blog about a guy going off as to how great this place was. So my wife and I drove to Brossard to check it out.\n\nThe restaurant is laid out very unusually, its half a bar, pizza place and the other half is the breakfast side. When you first arrive we thought we entered the wrong place, because it was a pizza joint with no server present. Once we walked through the pizza place we entered the side of the breakfast place where some random waiter said \"ya just sit anywhere\". The food was so-so, nothing to write home about really. I had the eggs Benedict, and while edible, the hollandaise was a bit bland and the potatoes seemed like an afterthought. My wife's omelette was similarly unremarkable. The atmosphere felt a bit disjointed, and the initial confusion certainly didn't help set a positive tone. Given the drive and the underwhelming experience, I'm not sure we'll be making a return trip. It certainly didn't live up to the blog's hype.",
        "One of the few places that was open for Christmas and what a unexpected present! My bar manager at Fez used to manage for the this restaraunt and suggested we all go in a group. Now, pulling into this place it looked like it would be some hole in the wall restaraunt. It was all black on the outside, so you couldn't see in and it was in a strip mall!! But let me tell ya, when you walk in there is an immediate change of heart as soon as you see the fountain waterfall in front of you.\n\nIt was like stepping into an elegant, inviting oasis! The interior was beautifully decorated and warm. Despite it being Christmas Day, the service was impeccable and genuinely friendly. Every dish we ordered was simply delicious and beautifully presented. My steak was perfectly cooked, and my friends raved about their pasta. This place turned a potentially tough holiday meal into a delightful, memorable experience. A true hidden gem \u2013 highly recommend!",
        "The food was fresh, well prepared and delicious. The service was friendly and attentive. Not a fan of the ambiance, but I'm not there to eat the decor.\n\nI went on a Saturday night around 6pm it was busy but not packed. I had samosas and they were freshly made, crispy on the outside and tender inside with a little spice. I tried the szechuan chicken, basically fried chicken pieces with onion, green peppers and hot peppers which again were freshly made, crispy outside and tender inside.\n\nI was looking for a quick and satisfying meal, and this place absolutely delivered. The portions were generous, especially for the price point, making it excellent value. Despite my reservations about the rather dated decor, the quality of the cuisine truly shone through. I left feeling completely satisfied and impressed by the vibrant flavors and the genuine warmth of the staff. This spot is definitely a hidden gem for anyone craving authentic and delicious Indian/Chinese fusion.",
        "The first time I came here, I recognized the lady working the counter was the lady who worked at Jenni Pho. I can't comment on the pho as my favorite dish is the dried vermicelli salad. I also ordered their 3-bean dessert. It was a good first experience which deemed for a second trip.\n\nMy second visit was not as good. Because It was a work day, I decided to use the drive through, however when I got to the drive through there was a sign that said \"come inside to see the menu.\" This was quite inconvenient, especially when trying to save time on a lunch break. I went inside and ordered my usual dried vermicelli salad. While the food was still decent, it didn't have the same fresh, vibrant taste as my first visit, and the portion felt slightly smaller. The 3-bean dessert remained a highlight, but the initial hassle and the slight dip in food quality made the experience less enjoyable overall. I'm torn on whether to give them another shot, but if I do, I'll definitely skip the drive-through and dine in.",
        "I used to love coming to Mimi's when I would be in town visiting family. It used to be crowded and we'd have to rush to beat the line. Sadly those times are done....I will not be back!\n\nWhen we got there at 6pm the place was empty. Score!?! No, its empty because it has majority gone down hill. We had 4 people and split 2 dinner for 2s and we got the baked brie also. Regarding our 5 appetizers: baked brie bleh (better not melted and not enough bread), house **salads were limp and drowned in dressing. The French Onion soups, usually a highlight, were watery and lacked flavor \u2013 just sad. Then came the main courses from our 'dinner for 2s.' The chicken was dry, and the pasta dishes tasted like they'd been reheated multiple times. Everything felt tired, from the food to the service which was slow despite the emptiness. It's truly heartbreaking to see a beloved spot fall so far. Save your money and memories; this isn't the Mimi's you remember.**",
        "I went here with the high hopes that it will be my new favorite place since there are great positive reviews about it.. sadly, my hopes were all shattered :(\n\nService: If I could give a negative star, I would. We were seated right away at the bar, but then, it has been 10 minutes at least, and no one had taken the initiative to give us a menu or offer a drink. My boyfriend ended up getting a menu himself up front. After that, still nothing. So I asked the chef on the bar (I think he's the owner) if someone could please assist us. He barely made eye contact, just shrugged, and motioned dismissively towards a server who was busy chatting at the other end of the bar. We felt completely ignored and, honestly, quite unwelcome. After another five minutes of being invisible, we decided enough was enough. We simply got up and left without ever placing an order. It's truly disappointing when a place fails so spectacularly on basic hospitality. We never even got a chance to try the food, and I certainly won't be back.",
        "This place is a F N joke!!! I took my car to the Henderson shop for a routine oil change, expecting professional service. Instead, I got pure incompetence. My car has a plastic undercarriage cover that needs to be removed to access the oil filter. Not only did their 'mechanic' remove it, but they clearly couldn't be bothered to put it back on. Finding that missing was infuriating and completely unacceptable.\n\nAs if that wasn't bad enough, they tried to upsell me on an air filter, claiming mine needed to be replaced. Funny, considering I just installed a brand new one myself last week! It's insulting to be treated like I know nothing about my own vehicle. Then there's the 'synthetic blend oil' claim. Yeah, right. After these issues, I have zero trust in anything they say.\n\nDO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR THERE!!!! This was an absolute nightmare. I should have known better. I will never again take my car to this establishment, and I urge everyone to stay far, far away. Save yourself the headache and potential damage to your vehicle.",
        "I ate here last week. I initially enjoyed the ambiance, the nice wait staff, and the wide selection of sushi, robata, and cocktails. However, our food and drinks were littered with inedible garnishes. One of our drinks contained inedible wood sticks and leaves, while the plate came with a side of hollowed out crustacean appendages.\n\nWhile I understand that the harvested tree parts add to the flavor of the drink, the crustacean carcases added nothing to the plate other than to disgust their customers. It was an incredibly off-putting experience. While I appreciate creativity in presentation, there's a fine line between artistic flair and just plain gross. Serving what looked like discarded crab shells next to our beautifully prepared sushi made us question the hygiene and intent. It completely overshadowed any positive aspects of the meal. We left feeling more bewildered than satisfied, and definitely won't be returning. A shame, as the potential is there, but the execution needs a serious re-think.",
        "I had mentioned to my boyfriend that I needed to renew my eyeglass prescription, and he mentioned the deal America's best had where you can get an eye exam and 2 pairs of glasses including the lenses for $69.99. I needed contacts as well and when I called the store, I specifically asked if there was a way to get both the eyeglass and contact lens exam for an additional cost. The woman on the phone told me for $79.99 I could have both the eyeglass exam and contact lens exam, so just $10 more.\n\nI was genuinely impressed by this incredible value! Booking the appointment was straightforward, and when I arrived, the staff was welcoming and efficient. Dr. Smith (or generic pleasant doctor) was thorough with both exams, clearly explaining everything and answering all my questions. There was no pressure to upgrade or add unnecessary extras. Picking out frames was easy with their wide selection, and ordering my contacts was a breeze. For the price, the service and quality truly exceeded my expectations. America's Best really lives up to its name for affordability and great care. I highly recommend them!",
        "We dined here this evening with my daugher's dance studio being located in the same plaza. We were both super excited to get a Greek place nearby and had waited anxiously since we saw the signage up prior to opening. It was pretty disappointing, I am sad to say :(\\n\\nWe had to wait about 5 minutes at the counter to place our order and finally, I think one of the owners, came over to assist us in our order. We waited almost 40 minutes for one gyro plate and one souvlaki plate although they did bring out soup samples. While the gesture was kind, it didn't make up for the extensive delay. When our food finally arrived, the gyro meat was dry and the fries were cold. My daughter's souvlaki was bland and lacked vibrant Greek flavors. The portions felt small for the price too. Overall, the long wait combined with the subpar food made for a truly underwhelming experience. We had such high hopes, but unfortunately, we won't be rushing back.",
        "I was in Las Vegas a couple of weeks ago for work. On Friday night we went out for a group dinner at Enoteca. I have never been to this establishment but having been to Carnevino and having a WONDERFUL dinner I had expectations.\n\nEnoteca is a bit more casual and low key than Carne and offers pastas, pizzas and a small variety of entrees.\n\nOur group started with a selection of cheeses, Prosciutto di Parma and fried squash blossoms. Not being a huge fan of fried squash blossoms, I was pleasantly surprised by their delicate flavor. The cheese and prosciutto were excellent. For my main, I chose the Tagliatelle Bolognese, which was perfectly rich and satisfying. My colleagues also enjoyed their various pizzas and the Branzino. Enoteca, while certainly more casual than Carnevino, offers an equally authentic and delicious Italian experience. The service was attentive, and the ambiance inviting. It's a fantastic spot for a relaxed group dinner, offering wonderful food without the formality.",
        "OWNERS - STAY AWAY FROM THEM!!!!!!!!\nRead the other reviews. They are all true. This company could care less about you and your tenants. I won't even go into my long list of problems because they have an excuse to justify everything they do. Seriously, look at how much time the owner spends responding to complaints on this site. He doesn't know how to say \"I am sorry, I did not service your account correctly, let me fix it.\" Instead, he puts 100% of his effort into laying blame at everyone else's feet. It's utterly exhausting. My experience has been a constant battle against their incompetence and complete lack of accountability. Every issue is met with a defensive counter-argument rather than a solution. They are not interested in resolving problems; they are only interested in avoiding responsibility. Save yourself the headache, frustration, and financial strain. Find a management company that actually values its clients and tenants, and is willing to admit when they've messed up. This isn't it.",
        "Shocker folks, I don't normally like hot dogs. The only way you can hand me a hot dog I'll actually eat is if it's fresh off the grill. With loads of ketchup...and I DO mean loads, like buckets full! If I ever think of eating a hot dog without ketchup, the world may end. The world kinda did tonight...a little.\n\nI ordered the New York Dog and the Sweetbread Dog, plus the duck fat fries to split with my friend. I had to order the NYC Dog because I love me some sauerkraut and a good snap. It was great, but the Sweetbread Dog... that was the shocker. I took a bite, then another, then another. No ketchup. Not a single squirt! The rich, savory sweetness of the sweetbread, combined with the perfectly grilled dog, was so unexpectedly incredible that I didn't want to drown it. My world didn't end; it just got a whole lot more delicious. Oh, and the duck fat fries? Crispy perfection. This place is a revelation!",
        "If I could post zero stars, that's what I would do. Let me preface this with the fact that we got here at 7pm on a Saturday...busy time for sure, but a restaurant should be able to forecast for that. After placing our orders, our waiter let's me know that I got the last order of brisket available (again, it's only 7pm on a saturday). Next, our food comes and here's where the real fun starts. My Mom's pulled pork looks chopped (as opposed to actually pulled) and it's DRY AS a desert. Truly inedible. My 'last order' of brisket was tough, flavorless, swimming in bland sauce. My brother's ribs were overcooked mush, and dad's chicken was rubbery. Our overwhelmed waiter offered no solutions, just a weak offer to replace food we had no faith in. Even the sides were dismal. This was a complete Saturday night disaster. Save your money and go elsewhere. We left utterly ripped off. Avoid!"
