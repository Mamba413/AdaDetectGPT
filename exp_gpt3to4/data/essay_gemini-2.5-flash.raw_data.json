        "Circumstances and Encountered Issues In the case study presented, the overall setting surrounding the Asian Health Services (AHS) corporation appears to put additional pressure on the enterprise's executives. AHS is a prosperous organization that was able to process over 117,000 patient visits in 2014 and possessed seven sites in addition to three owned properties (Chung & Chin, 2015). However, with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the situation changed drastically, creating both advantages and disadvantages for AHS. Although ACA increased patient supply, the medical organization encountered a significant challenge when introducing the new uninsured clients into the system and beginning their treatment (Chung & Chin, 2015). Furthermore, under the introduced act, the quality of care had to be improved tremendously, and the pay for performance framework had to be implemented (Chung & Chin, 2015). In the long term, these challenges were overcome by establishing an electronic medical records system, focusing on patient support, and adding new services. Nonetheless, several issues remained to be addressed despite the successful changes. Currently, the organization needs to enhance its efforts in providing better care for its employees. As such, the customer services department requires more multilingual staff for efficient communication, while the chief medical officer argues that physicians and other providers need additional incentives (Chung & Chin, 2015). The medical and dental clinics were",
        "One of the social factors that might impact what groceries are purchased is the lack of healthy food. Addressing Wal-Mart in Forest Part allows me to gather enough information about available products and their prices. For example, one gallon of great value milk is $2.65, one loaf of Sara Lee bread is $2.44, one bag of gala apples is $3.58, and one bag of organic baby carrots is $3.88. Continuing my visit, the prices are as follows: one yogurt container is $1.92, 2-liter of Pepsi Soda is $1.98, one bag of chips is $2.84, and one family-size pack of cookies is $3.98. In Maywood, IL 60153, the population is mostly African Americans (68.6%), but white citizens (18.2%) and Hispanic/Latino (26.9%) also live there (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). The chosen living area lacks good grocery stores, but the number of fast-food restaurants has significantly increased during the last few years. It means that people are not able to buy healthy food but have to eat poor-quality products, contributing to their health problems like hypertension and diabetes. Another social factor that affects human health and shopping habits is poor transformation and the impossibility for the working class to visit Wal-Mart regularly. The median household income in the chosen region is about $50,176, and the poverty level is about 15% (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). It means that not all individuals can",
        "Every business must be managed carefully, and every detail must receive a fair amount of attention. When it comes to healthcare, such facilities must require even more attention because they focus on people's well-being. Performing such duties might be strenuous and expensive, and mentally demanding. As a Chief Nursing Officer, one will be faced with principles that include integrity maintenance, cash flow management, and employee motivation in the given circumstances. To start with, a healthcare business must always maintain its integrity. It can be evident that any business field should be focused on communication, which makes integrity a vital part (Fisher, 2008). In the given facility, the integrity maintenance principle is heavily adhered to. First of all, every doctor follows an ethical code, meaning that they know of doctor-patient confidentiality. Moreover, doctors and nurses focus on honest communication with patients. For example, in my situation, I tell patients about their actual conditions and honestly answer their questions. Another important business principle is proper cash flow management. Healthcare facility requires renovations and innovations, meaning that there will constantly be situations when new equipment or repairs will be needed (Mason et al., 2020). In this situation, it is highly necessary to implement the needed changes to not jeopardize patients' health and well-being. For example,",
        "Different circumstances under which medical staff has worked led to varying types of leadership strategies being developed. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the role of clear communication and the handling of prompt preparation in top healthcare leaders (Nicola et al., 2020). Another key tactic includes the use of external change agents that ultimately promote excellent organizational decision-making (Alagoz et al., 2018). Moreover, one study explained how implementing positivity-related and open-minded approaches as leaders can improve their employee's resilience, providing an additional source of motivation (Wei et al., 2018). Hence, effective healthcare leaders must adapt to various external changes and strategically communicate with their coworkers. Several departments can be interacted with through the role of a healthcare administrator. One of them includes the in-patient department where multiple approaches from skilled professionals are needed. Moreover, critical care and A&E require excellent management and collaborating opportunities. As already mentioned, the selected healthcare areas are prime examples of fields requiring strong leaders to provide optimal patient care. One way this can be improved to obtain the desired outcomes is through a holistic approach that considers external and internal factors. Furthermore, collective decision-making should not be viewed as limiting to effective leadership; on the contrary, it presents an ideal strategy in healthcare management. The importance of interprofessional collaboration in medical institutions is evident through its effect on",
        "Creating a legal definition for various ages is crucial for lawmakers in America. By establishing the boundaries between childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, it becomes possible to clarify the specifics of such periods and behaviors that the individuals might demonstrate. However, as explained by Scott (2000) in The Legal Construction of Adolescence, there are several complications connected to clearly defining the end of childhood and the overall period of adolescence. While childhood and adulthood ages can be specified by distinguishing between the children's vulnerability and adults' responsibility, adolescent populations' ages are more difficult to determine due to the transitional nature of this growth period. In the contemporary legal framework, adolescence is not properly defined. Nevertheless, it appears that not including this term in the system is a highly successful tactic that allows the policymakers to avoid additional confusion that is connected to the introduction of a new concept. As such, the categorical approach is most commonly used when managing cases of adolescents, thus relying on the concept of the age of majority (Scott, 2000). In this sense, anyone under the age of majority is legally considered a minor, eliminating the need to account for individual developmental characteristics or differences in maturity (Scott, 2000). Therefore, all people under the age of 18 are currently regarded as minors. However, this legal framework fails to account for the numerous factors affecting young",
        "Retailers, Wholesalers and Manufacturers are three stakeholder groups that can greatly contribute to financial success or failure of a business. All three of them are involved in the supply chains of most middle and large-scale product-oriented businesses. The three groups have certain aspects in common but are drastically different in how they engage with a firm's products and its customers. The differences apply to the amounts of goods a group is dealing with as part of its function, as well as its direct role in the chain. Retailers earn money by acquiring things in bulk at a discount from wholesalers and reselling them for a profit. They seek to shift such things across as quickly as possible in order to reduce inventory holding expenses. They, however, then resell the items on a comparatively small scale and don't facilitate bulk-buying. Out of the three groups, retailers are the most consumer-oriented, and offer direct customer service to those who attend them to buy products from multiple brands. Wholesalers acquire items in bulk from producers and resell them to retailers and consumers at a profit. Wholesalers take on a moderate level of risk, acting as a part of the chain of middlemen (Bowersox, 2019). To be lucrative, they must acquire items in large quantities and deliver them to merchants on time. If the products do not sell and merchants do",
        "The Spirit bear of the British Colony is a unique species of bears that amaze with their appearance and are of particular importance to the population of British Columbia. This type of animal is a kind of Kermode bear and is a subspecies of black bears, which often have dark fur (Service, 2017). However, due to a genetic mutation, some of the representatives of spirit bears have a white coat color, which is why they have such an interesting name (Langlois, 2017). Like many representatives of this species, they weigh an average of two hundred kilograms (Service, 2017). Many sources note the extreme rarity of this type of bear and only estimated about four hundred species in British Columbia, which determines the need to preserve them (Groc, n.d.). Moreover, it is believed that they are closely related to the indigenous population of America, as they contribute to the development of the ecosystem in which they live, which makes them extremely important. The indigenous population also has a legend that spirit bears could swim deep underwater and bring people to a magical place. Spirit bears can often be found in the Great Bear Rainforest, with almost seven million hectares of rainforest (Langlois, 2017). Another feature of these animals is a particular love for salmon. In addition, bears eat berries, insects, plants, fruits, and nuts (Service, 2017). Kermodes are also very shy and mystical, which also causes",
        "Communication and collaboration are crucial elements for the success of any individual and team effort. The first chapter of the book Technical Communication provides insight into the aspects of technical communication and its importance. I discovered that technical communication addresses two main tasks: assisting people in learning about certain phenomena or how to do a certain task. Additionally, technical communication can make others strengthen their attitudes, change them, or even take particular actions. I also found that technical documents reflect organizational culture, are made in collaboration and have distinctive elements, including a particular reader, clear instructions on resolving an issue, design, images, and words. Finally, I discovered that technical communication was a valuable skill in the workplace since it allows people to read and produce technical documents. When collaborating with my colleagues and other students, I have had many different experiences. The negative collaboration experience concerned the lack of willingness of certain members of the team to contribute to the joint work (Markel & Selber, 2021). These people did not share their ideas because the team engaged in active brainstorming, and every time they tried to present their perspectives, they were interrupted by other people. Essentially, the lack of control was the cause of the people's lack of involvement, but the problem could have",
        "The European powers had taken major parts of the world, including the Caribbean. In the 15 th century, the Europeans claimed the region following the establishment of Spanish settlements and conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires (Horne, 2018). Due to the conquest, it was easy for the Spanish to invade Mexico and Peru through exploration in strategic points of the Caribbean region. Following the Spanish invasion of the Caribbean in the 17th century, other European powers such as the British and French started settling in pivotal points such as the island of Tortuga and later moved to Jamaica (Horne, 2018). By mid-century, many non-Hispanic privateers had established permanent colonies and trading zones in Caribbean islands. The profitability in terms of wealth enabled rise of conquest to Caribbean region. First, it was easy to obtain gold, which was among the region's key aspects of the scramble. The existence of Christopher Columbus in the region had shown the way for other leaders to set colonies (Horne, 2018). Second, there was the availability of a labor force drawn from the African continent as black people were used as slaves to work in the industrial openings in the area. Due to the decline of Spanish power in the region, majorly as a result of reduced",
        "It is clear to modern people, as well as many people who lived in the 1930s, that the Second World War was inevitable. Some believe that the United States of America could prevent the outbreak of the war. However, this could hardly be possible due to several reasons. The American government maintained an isolationist foreign policy in the 1930s. The period was challenging as all countries had to address severe economic issues (Corbett et al., 2021). Americans wanted to concentrate on domestic matters, including a threatening spread of communist ideas (Russett, 2019). It is noteworthy that the USA could hardly interfere and have a considerable impact on European affairs due to the country's comparatively low economic might. The United States was not a financial leader at that period, so its influence was limited. Moreover, the USA alone could not prevent the world war because it was outbroken as a result of the clash between European countries. The outcomes of the Treaty of Versailles laid the ground for the new war, as almost all stakeholders were dissatisfied. Germany accumulated resources and developed alliances with other dictatorships, so any country could not play a decisive role in this conflict. No nation could prevent the start of the new war as the regimes that emerged in Europe (the communist",
        "In order to better understand the higher prevalence of diabetes within the county, it is essential to observe both national and local trends of the illness. According to the CDC (2022), while new cases of diabetes have steadily decreased over the decades, the prevalence of the disease among people aged below twenty has not. Similarly, the prevention and management of diabetes among older adults is largely unsatisfactory and could be vastly improved. A number of socio-cultural factors also influence the prevalence of diabetes. For instance, individuals with Hispanic backgrounds are more prone to have the condition. Other factors such as age, smoking, physical inactivity, and obesity among residents could also be impacting the prominence of diabetes. Within the setting of the county, it is likely that age, elevated hypertension, and Hispanic backgrounds are the main risk factors for residents. While age and increased blood pressure are more common risks for type 2 diabetes, the Hispanic background component may be a more recent development that is influenced by a number of social factors (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, n.d.). While Hispanic individuals have a mild genetic predisposition to diabetes that may be affected by traditional foods that are rich in carbohydrates, lack of access to healthcare is the most prominent risk factor. A study has found that health insurance disparities,",
        "There is a growing number of physicians' encounters with the victims of human trafficking, sometimes even without recognizing them as such. Recently, Todres (2017) reported an incident, where Dr. W was requested to screen the women-employees of such a firm for sexually transmitted infections. On the one hand, according to the Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association (2011), it is necessary to safeguard patient confidentiality, including several aspects, such as physical, informational, decisional, and associational privacy. At the same time, it is obligatory to keep the records of all the patients in the healthcare settings while Dr. W was asked not to maintain them to avoid possible arrest of these women. Thus, the doctor understood that in another case, the employees of this firm would not have a chance for diligent healthcare and, moreover, could possibly spread the STIs further. The case engages issues in several fields, such as criminal law, ethical concerns, human rights, and service provider regulations. From the side of conspiracy law, it is possible to assume that the agreement of Dr. W is equal to the participation in the crime. As she is aware of the crime and did not report it but helped in its realization, the court's decision can be not in her favor. From the",
        "The foundation myths of Rome represent some of the qualities vital for a successful state in antiquity \u2013 decisiveness, militancy, and political and social flexibility. Historians of different sorts have been trying to understand and interpret the story of Romulus and Remus since its creation. The following stages of Rome's supposed history also raise many questions regarding fratricide, abduction, rape, and also the backgrounds of Rome's first citizens. The fact that according to most of the myths, Rome started from fratricide seems to be quite relevant as the city's history is famously filled with civil conflicts and wars. Many historians tried to sugarcoat this episode \u2013 Cicero ignored it, Dionysius of Halicarnassus depicted Romulus as full of regret, and Egnatius suggested that Remus had survived and outlived Romulus (as cited in Beard, 2015). Another Roman historian \u2013 Livy \u2013 told the story of Romulus reacting to his brother's actions, therefore, portraying the city's founder as a hard, bellicose, but rather just person (as cited in Beard, 2015). Regardless of the interpretations, it seems that belligerence, resoluteness, and willingness to quickly resolve both internal and external conflicts with blood found their reflection in Roman myths and history. On the other hand, the history of Rome is the history of unprecedented openness, inclusiveness, and social mobility. The fact that the majority of first Roman citizens supposedly were criminals may cast an unpleasant shadow on the city's legacy, yet in the",
        "Portraying the lives of gods and depicting relationships between them, as well as their interactions with humans, both \u201cIliad\u201d and \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d elaborate on the theme of power abuse by those at the helm. In \u201cIliad,\u201d Agamemnon has to face retribution due to his constant abuse of power: \u201cbe ready, that I be not left,/Alone of all the Greeks, without my prize\u201d (Homer, 762 B. C.). Likewise, in \u201cMetamorphosis,\u201d various deities display complete disrespect for those of lesser power: \u201cWhat had escaped the waves, now feared the flame\u201d (Ovid, 8 B.C.). However, unlike the \u201cIliad,\u201d \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d rarely demonstrates the comeuppance that deities have to face for their negligence of mortals' needs (Homer, 762 B. C.; Ovid, 8 B. C.). Therefore, while thematically similar, \u201cIliad\u201d and \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d represent slightly different perspectives on the problem o power abuse. The theme of mortals' protection, which is central both to \u201cIliad\u201d and \u201cMetamorphosis,\u201d remains essential nowadays as well. Namely, a range of contemporary leaders appear to have tremendous amounts of power due to their political influence, their economic one, or a combination of both (Homer, 762 B. C.; Ovid, 8 B. C.). For instance, the disregard for human rights in countries such as China, where leaders attain the status of god-like creatures, can be",
        "The rate of patient mortality in intensive care is a growing concern for medical practitioners. Although the cause of patient motility may be attributed to many factors even before the individual reaches the CCU, it has been reported that an effective tube placement during resuscitation aids healthy circulation. It is not known if the nurse's knowledge of capnography affects its use in critical care units. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the relationship between nurses' knowledge of capnography and its use in coronary care units. The project will provide valuable insight into factors affecting the use of capnography, thus contributing to the field and filling the gap in the literature. The intervention protocol will train nurses on the benefit of capnography and test their implementation in critical care units. Based on the training and testing, the goal is to facilitate the implementation of capnography use in the selected CCU. The intervention will also enable accurate tube placement to stimulate normal chest circulation during resuscitation, improve quality care delivery, and patient recovery in critical care units. The project will recruit nurses working in the selected coronary care unit in Central Jersey. This setting was chosen because of the high incidence of nurse's refusal to use capnography during resuscitation. The project timeline is twenty-four weeks. The selected participants will be based on the inclusion criteria, and their test results will be confidential and used solely for testing nursing knowledge of capnography. This project will facilitate",
        "The phrase that caught me most from the video is from Isaiah, stating that Samuel has taught him that one person can play t-ball and hit it hard when sitting down. This is a powerful statement indicating that people can be prejudiced despite having good intentions. Samuel's family did not realize the struggles disabled people go through before he was born (PinehurstPictures, 2010). The child's image hitting the t-ball also showcased a powerful issue, that disabled individuals should be treated similarly to other people and given equal opportunities to give them the chance to perform optimally. I was intrigued to see children like Nathanial Orellana learning in a normal classroom. His mother determined they sought school actively to ensure he received the best care considering his autism (PinehurstPictures, 2010). Parents face a myriad of extra challenges raising disabled children to give them advantages that would help them compete with their peers in society. The video illustrates that communities and the government should provide parents with a variety of schools to determine the best for their child's disability. Children with disabilities require special care but should be allowed to interact with others if their illness would not worsen based on these connections. Engagement is a crucial tool for child development as it requires them to be attentive and active, propagating greater achievement due to increased enthusiasm. Nathanial raises his hand",
        "Slavery has been one of the most problematic aspects of the history of humankind. Slavery developed as European trading and marine settlements which required additional labor in the American colonies (Harris, 2018). Settlers comprised enslaved people from Native Americans and forcibly brought Africans, using slave labor in every part of the economy, from sugar production to harvesting and exploration of raw materials (Harris, 2018). The practice of slavery in British North America can be characterized by how colonists regarded enslaved people. As slavery gradually spread across America, each area had distinctions. For instance, Jamestown in Virginia became the first permanent British settlement through which enslaved Africans were brought to North America (Harris, 2018). Similar to Jamestown, other port cities practiced slavery primarily by connecting the international slave trade with rural and urban slave markets (Harris, 2018). Slavery practices were perceived to extend in Boston, which is believed to be the first place where someone tried to force enslaved people to have children to earn money (Harris, 2018). Later, Massachusetts enacted the first law of slavery in British North America (Harris, 2018). While the practice of slavery was developing throughout America, the labor roles did not vary much (Harris, 2018). Colonists used enslaved people as domestic labor or to farm and produce trade goods (Harris, 2018). Colonial regions captured people to force them to",
        "A Western scholarship has distorted the long history of African culture for centuries, and many of its basic principles have been viewed through the lens of colonization. As a result, the ideas and tenets of African philosophy have been appropriated and changed in value from the inherent parts of people's nature into commodities. In their works, p'Bitek and Marimba discuss such concepts as culture, spirituality, and philosophy of African nations and how Western ideology has reshaped their presentation without fully understanding their meaning. The commodification of African culture and the imposition of European views on the distinction between culture and philosophy, religion and spirituality have disrupted African people's ability to self-identify. The ideas by scholars show that African culture does not distinguish itself from philosophy or drive a line between reality and the spiritual nature of one's being. European culture is presented as pragmatical and commodifying \u2013 it turns pieces of life that are meant to be used into objects for observation. p'Bitek writes that culture turns from \u201cthe way of life of a people\u201d into \u201csomething that is bought and sold\u201d (\u201cWhat is Culture?\u201d 14). As a result, younger generations of Africans, especially those living in Western countries, see their culture as a collection of souvenirs, not parts of everyday life. At the same time, they are subjected to the Western religions praising",
        "Olivier Armantier's et al. article, \u201cHow Economic Crises Affect Inflation Beliefs: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic,\u201d was published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization on July 24, 2021. Publisher Elsevier has partnered with the Copyright Center RightsLink service to offer various options for reusing this content. Elsevier offers open or restricted access to content with permanently unique identifiers to include links and citations. This paper is an independent article focusing on the state of the public economy during COVID-19. In their paper, the authors examine changes in the perception of inflation during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this paper is an independent work, Armantier et al. (2021) complemented other research in the field analyzing economic changes during the COVID-19 recession. A feature of the article is the study by the authors of the consequences of inflationary crises and comparison with pre-existing crises to calculate the level of the crisis as a whole. The survey's main purpose is to collect against a wide range of economic outcomes. As a result of their research, the authors studied the evolution of households' perceptions of inflation and concluded that the growth of inflationary expectations was more restrained. It means that the muted reaction of average inflation expectations masks a significant polarization of views, especially in the short term (Bekaert et al., 2020). A significant proportion of households, particularly those with higher education, initially",
        "The global pandemic caused by the COVID-19 has led to severe issues in the labor market. To be more particular, the number of unemployed individuals is considerably higher than prior to the global lockdown (The Economist, para. 2). Naturally, such a situation happened due to businesses going bankrupt or reducing the number of employees to survive the economic crisis. The Economist elaborates on the statistics of the unemployment rate and shares the amount of time it can take for the labor market to recover to its prior-pandemic state (para. 1-3). This issue is complex, so McConnell et al. cover the primary aspects that contribute to it in chapters 12, 15, and 18. The 12th chapter reveals the governmental response to the labor market and how it is regulated during a crisis or similar circumstances (McConnell et al.). The 15th part indicates the detail of job hunting, which is relevant to the topic, considering that people failed to land a job because of the severe economic situation (McConnell et al.). Finally, the last chapter includes the analysis of employment and unemployment and how they affect the labor market on the whole. The economist, Gary Becker, earned the Nobel Prize for outstanding contributions to the field of economy, applying the theories for human",
        "Economic globalization is an inevitable process due to many reasons, but many people argue that it has a detrimental effect on the development of many countries or even the entire world. Nevertheless, globalization positively influences the evolution of human society at large, although some adverse effects are apparent (Wade, 2004). First, it is essential to understand the benefits of economic globalization to embrace it rather than try to oppose it. Undoubtedly, economic globalization enables people to trade more efficiently and effectively as they have access to diverse resources and markets. An entrepreneur in every part of the world can offer products and services to people from other continents with the help of technology. The abundance of ideas contributes to the creation of new products making people's lives more comfortable (Sen, 2012). Individuals, companies, and countries can collaborate to conduct complex projects. However, such aspects as inequality are often raised in relation to economic globalization. It is argued that globalization is a manifestation of western imperialism as rich countries exploit the resources of developing countries (Sen, 2012). As a result, the opponents of globalization argue poor countries become even poorer. However, it is found that globalization is not directly linked to poverty and equality (Wade, 2004). Poor countries' governments' inability to cope with corruption and the lack of",
        "The \u201cEye of the Storm\u201d video is a fascinating example of how race can be socially constructed in the classroom. Jane Elliott created a distinction between blue-eyed and brown-eyed children, teaching the young participants that their peers with brown eyes were superior (Bloom). Although this contrast does not possess any inherent meaning and is merely a representation of one's amount of melanin in the body, it became significant for the children. Thus, Elliott socially constructed race by suggesting that one group of children is better than the other, with the eye colors serving as symbols to emphasize race and group belonging. As a result of such distinction, differences in the students' activities and performance became evident. Elliott observed that the children who were in the brown-eyed group grew more confident, and they began to behave more condescendingly towards their blue-eyed peers. Contrastingly, the latter students have been reported to become more shy and timid, supposedly intimidated by the pressure from the other group (Bloom). Blue-eyed children felt less reassured, with their academic performance dropping significantly and their relationships with their former brown-eyed classmates becoming worse (Bloom). By the end of the activity, a drastic difference between the two groups was remarkably clear, and fights between the learners could be seen frequently. Thus, each group was negatively impacted",
        "The differences between the Persian and Greek cultures can be seen in several traditions and customs. In Persia, the distinction between different religions and languages was accepted by the society, allowing people from the conquered territories to continue practicing their ancestral traditions without being persecuted (Brooks, 2019). In contrast, Greeks were less tolerant of other religions and cultures, enforcing submission to Greek customs from the populations residing in their territory (Brooks, 2019). Another significant dissimilarity was the citizens' attitude toward the authority, with the Persian residents voluntarily supporting the King and remaining strongly loyal to him (Brooks, 2019). In Greece, where the democratic rule was considered the most beneficial, the concept of one person reigning over others was disapproved, with the majority of the elite supporting democracy as a just distribution of power. The political structures of Persia and Greece were also highly distinct, as each system was to support the established governing methods. Persian government allowed for efficient control over separated locations and managed the authority of the leaders who were given the most power, the political governors and military generals (Brooks, 2019). Alternatively, the Greek political system was based on democracy, but it was highly unequal and challenging to manage over long distances (Brooks, 2019). Another crucial aspect of Persian leadership was",
        "The main difference with regard to various gender theories is how they explain the gendered differences in behaviors characteristic for both sexes. When applied to the issue of behavioral problems in males, different theories find their causes in different sources. Biological determinism would explain behavioral issues in male students through the concept of male nature as inherently and naturally competitive, aggressive, and even violent (Tilling, 2013). However, this essentialist theory is at odds with the now well-established understanding that, while some people are predisposed toward delinquency, social influences are a far more prominent cause thereof (Delcea et al., 2019). In contrast to biological determinism, the social construction of gender theory posits that people enact gendered behaviors as they learn them from others and internalize gender norms dominant in their cultures (Tilling, 2013). This approach would explain the correlation between the male sex and behavioral problems through Western cultures' promotion of aggressive notions of masculinity, going as far as to encourage bullying (Rosen and Nofziger, 2019). In short, the crucial difference between gender theories explaining behavioral problems in males is where they look for answers. Knowing about and understanding these gender theories is obviously relevant for teaching in more ways",
        "Diana Kendall claims the current perception of the class has been a construct of the media and based on the construction, the meaning of class is determined. Kendall argues that the media has legitimized inequality in the United States through the assumption, with television programs and newspaper articles creating and reifying class-based stereotypes. Furthermore, Kendall argues that class discussions in the media are rarely explicit; however, their portrayals generate perspectives that impact human behavior. The upper class in society is portrayed positively, while the lower class is framed negatively. On the one hand, the upper class contains individuals that should be emulated, comprised of caring and generous people, and those with criminal records have remarkably good lives (Kendall 10). On the other hand, the lower class is framed as homeless, poor, largely ignored by the media, and often discussed as abstract statistics. As such, when casting a human face, the demographics of the poor determine how they are framed. The quality of life may deteriorate from the understanding that as the media focuses on the upper class's viewpoints and gives voice to their concerns, it neglects the concerns of lower-class members. The conveyed class discourses by the media, including constructions of the homeless and the poor, portrays a lifestyle inflicted by laziness, diseases, crime, and substance abuse (Kendall 94). The dehumanized statistics associated with personalized suffering",
        "Terrorism is one of the main problems faced by humanity in the 21st century and, despite considerable countermeasures, it remains topical. Islamic terrorism is one of the most prominent forms of the radicalism of the past decades, which manifested itself in several tragic events. The movement began when Osama Bin Laden formed al Qaeda in 1989, which conducted its first attack in Yemen by placing a bomb in a hotel housing American troops (\u201cOsama bin Laden,\u201d 2020). Osama Bin Laden espoused the idea of worldwide Jihad, a holy war of Muslims against the infidels and especially the United States. The main terrorist attack of al Qaeda was the 9/11 Bombing of the World Trade Centers, claiming the lives of thousands of people and leading to the beginning of the War on Terror (\u201cOsama bin Laden,\u201d 2020). Eventually, the United States Military located Osama bin Laden and killed him, yet it did not stop other Islamic radicals from carrying out attacks. One of them was the Boston Marathon Bombings event which were orchestrated by followers of Osama bin Laden (Breuninger, 2021). The continuing terrorist attacks cause numerous concerns to emerge over the effectiveness of the United States War on Terror. Yet, it is still one of the responsibilities of the country to act as the world's \u201cpoliceman\u201d since the United States is the only global superpower capable of establishing control",
        "A trade secret is one of the most valuable components of a company's functioning, which can provide it with a significant competitive advantage. Hence, it consists in confidential information that describes the processes or things that characterize the organization. It can be a phrase, a slogan, a symbol, or a mixture of these aspects. To qualify for a trademark, the information must correspond to specific points. It must have commercial value for the company, must be known to a limited number of people, and fall under such documents as consent to conceal data for the persons by whom it is used. Unlike a trademark, a trade secret is characterized by large scales. The first concept includes the protection of the name, logo, packaging of a product or service under a trademark. A trade secret as an intellectual property includes such concepts as patent, copyright, and trademarks (Andreicovici, 2021). The unauthorized acquisition, use, or disclosure of such secret information in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices by others is regarded as an unfair practice and a violation of the trade secret protection. The protection of the trade secret takes place in compliance with two mandatory forms. It can be said that the most important of them becomes through the creation of agreements, contracts, and procedures for establishing documentary protection of",
        "Commitment to health theory is a special model designed to determine the stages of development and behavior changes. This theory assumes the development of an internal state, as well as the acceptance of the desire to lead a healthy lifestyle under the conditions that any circumstances may limit a person. Moreover, with the help of this theory, the necessary level is determined, which indicates a particular stage of human health (Kelly, 2014). In addition, this theory assumes that there are no established differences, such as gender, race, and others, in order to build behavior aimed at developing a healthy lifestyle. In her research, Kelly (2008) uses the principles of the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change. First of all, this is done in order to demonstrate certain stages of the change process. Furthermore, the model used sets specific requirements for health. Thus, the Commitment to Health Theory uses such principles as stages of change, decisive balance, and self-efficiency (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997). In this way, Kelly uses essential principles of this theory; thus, they are interrelated. Concerning advanced nursing practice, this theory can be used as a measurement of some patient indicators. Thus, this model will help determine the goals necessary for the patient to instill the desire to lead a healthy lifestyle. In practice, this theory",
        "The article of Zulaika (2022) presents the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on adolescent pregnancy and school dropout among secondary school girls in Kenya. The cases of teenage pregnancy started in Kenya after the country-wide school closure that started from March 2020 and lasted until January 2021. Zulaika (2022) examine to what extent the pandemic affected sexual and reproductive health of adolescents in Rarieda subcounty. The study shows there was a limited involvement of health administrators on the issue of pregnancy among school girls. Teenagers lack sexual education and are not aware of different methods of protection. Health administrators should find this issue important as early pregnancy can be dangerous for girls' health and lead to various socio-economic problems in the future. Moreover, if such a rate of adolescent pregnancy continues to increase, there would be less educated females in Kenya. Zulaika (2022) also mentions that stress level of pregnant teenagers is high, affecting mental as well as physical health of young future mothers. To tackle this issue, Zulaika (2022) suggests implementing population-level emergencies on girls that are going to school. Students should be educated for the basics of sexual education and for the side effects of sexual life. Furthermore, the article points out that infectious diseases can be spread rapidly if school girls do not know the importance of contraceptives. As such, there is",
        "The adjustment process of new children and their parents can be challenging for them and the teacher. An educator can implement many educational and communicational techniques to ease the process and support the children and parents. I believe that maintaining constant communication with parents through conferences or phone calls, with the consideration of their time and privacy, is one of the most important elements. Encouraging home learning activities and welcoming parents into the classroom is also crucial. Most parents would like to be involved in or informed about their children's adjustment in a new classroom. Gaining parents' trust by properly communicating with them and engaging them in collaborative problem-solving and planning would ease their and their children's adjustment process (Kuhn et al., 2017). Being mindful of their time and privacy is crucial in establishing a healthy parent-educator relationship. According to Lin et al. (2019), home learning activities can help children overcome their school involvement issues. Informing parents about the importance of home-based activities would encourage them to participate, resulting in parental support and involvement in the adjustment process of the children. For parents and children with separation anxiety, an educator can invite the parents into the classroom. However, it is vital to communicate the expectations and",
        "Both lookism and extreme body modification are inherently linked to unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standards of modern society. This trait aside, however, the two are very different in its manifestations and direct consequences. Lookism is merely the act of considering someone whose appearance is not what most people would regard to be beautiful. It focuses on exhibiting negative judgement to people that do not fit the standard and is thus oriented outside of the person who engages in it. Extreme body modification is the act of changing one's body in order to look in a way that deviates from the norms that society sets on appearance (Good, 2016). To contrast these two, one does not look pleasing in appearance, while the other intentionally marks oneself in ways that others would perceive as deviances or outside of societal standards. The differences between the two stem from their external or internal angles, despite both being related to the dissatisfaction with appearance. It is likely that a person who engages in lookism is deeply insecure about their own beauty, and thus takes a judgemental stance towards the beauty of others. Obsessiveness over other peoples' features or grooming habits generally signals a very unhealthy relationship with self-image, despite being less visible than bodily modifications (Good, 2016). Meanwhile, said modifications can happen both by a person's own accord, and as an act of social pressure or custom. An example of",
        "Frankenstein possesses both positive and negative traits that help readers build his character. The main hero can be looked at from diverse perspectives; therefore, the creation of Frankenstein's character can be seen as believable or even sympathetic. Due to his life difficulties, such as losing many of his family members or friends, Frankenstein is generally pitied by the majority of the audience. Later, the reader can understand that the main hero feels quite lonely and pays much attention to his research and studies to cover this inner loneliness caused by the loss of his beloved ones. Despite several inappropriate or sometimes immoral actions performed by Viktor Frankenstein, the readers have a tendency to consider his character quite sympathetic because of his traumatic past and lonely present. Additionally, the hero's character is even taken for attractive because Frankenstein possesses several positive traits such as improving his mind by constant reading, observing the surrounding nature, and being interested in many research fields (Bowta & Puhulawa, 2018). Because of these habits, the character is quite believable and trustworthy as well. Viktor Frankenstein's character can be considered a trope of warning, especially in several central situations in the novel. For instance, after creating his monster, the researcher simply escapes this creature and tries to hide because of the posed threat and a scary appearance (Bowta",
        "While the situation with the COVID-19 pandemic is critical, the case with mandatory vaccination at work is controversial. I think it is justified because it helps stop the pandemic; those unwilling to vaccinate should be ensured that they will not facilitate the contamination by the coronavirus. However, such a decision requires additional measures to ensure that the vaccine is safe and beneficial for the human organism. Despite a lack of time, as the pandemic must be conquered as soon as possible, the laws which require massive mandatory vaccination, under a threat of high fines, are the radical measure. They should be implemented carefully, as they may limit human rights and even be undemocratic, despite sometimes they are necessary to cope with challenging situations. In my opinion, the pandemic is such a situation, and it should be overcome. I think that mandatory vaccination does not violate the bill of rights only when everyone vaccinated knows clearly what they will obtain during the vaccination. In that way, the vaccine should be tested, and all test results should be available for check by each citizen. In my opinion, it would be even better if they could see all the processes of vaccine preparation. I personally would be much more confident in",
        "It should be noted that there is a multitude of motivational factors to consider for a manager from both personal and organizational standpoints. In the case of the former, these include personal investment, personal growth, recognition, and achievement. On the organizational level, equity plays a critical role in impacting motivation since if there is a perception of inequity, then the disadvantaged workers will lose motivation. Dan Pink claims that there are also critically important and effective intrinsic motivators, such as autonomy, mastery, and purpose (TED, 2009). In addition, there are extrinsic motivational factors, such as rewards, pay, and bonuses. The core motivational techniques, which have been used for the majority of management's existence as a practice, include reward-based systems, such as positive and negative reinforcements and punishments. However, the recent findings in the field of motivation reveal that for most employees, it is better to provide more autonomy, such as Fedex days, ROWE, or 20% Google systems (TED, 2009). I fall into the category of autonomy because it allows me to be free to do my work as I prefer. The work will no longer feel as if it is a forced activity, which wants me to operate as a machine or robot, but rather as a respected professional whom the employer",
        "The choice of ship is connected with the running costs of transportation. Stopford (2009) claims that the best way to reduce costs is to select newer ships, which require fewer crewmembers, less maintenance, and are more reliable. While all of these points are true, they do not automatically make newer ships the preferable choice for shipping costs. As it stands, 65% of all cargo ships in the world are over 14 years old, meaning that competition for newer ships is intense (Cheng, 2021). High demand means increased costs, which was demonstrated by the increase in cargo rates in 2021, and previously in 2016 (Cheng, 2021). Both of these surges saw a rise in demand for older ship services. As a rule, the offered costs of shipping by older vessels are cheaper. The reasons for that are the lower costs of purchasing a ship, which means lower pressure to repay the interest in time (Ros Chaos et al., 2021). In addition, companies running older vessels are aware of their disadvantages, thus needing to compensate for them by offering a more advantageous price. Finally, certain running costs for older ships can be mitigated by utilizing low-grade fuel, which these ships can still run on (Ros Chaos et al., 2021). In addition, while repairs and maintenance for",
        "Goals and objectives outline desired outcomes and, thus, are often used interchangeably. However, the effect, timeframe, and specificity of the two terms set them apart. Nickels et al. (2019) define goals as broad and long-term outcomes that an organization seeks, while objectives define the measurable, specific, and short-term strategies for attaining the identified goal. For example, the criminal justice system uses goals to task the police, correctional agencies, and the court with the strategy to execute, including deterrence, rehabilitation, retribution, restoration, and incapacitation. Therefore, the criminal justice system particularly addresses criminal behavior with the objective of protecting people's rights. In an era of rapid change, diversity, and complexity, leadership and management are critical to the survival of any agency. Besides, the ability to lead and manage strongly permeates every aspect of the criminal justice system. While leaders guide the change through a vision, managers implement coordinated processes and structures to pursue organizational goals and objectives (Nickels et al., 2019). Leaders are constantly challenged to take risks and encourage transformation. In law enforcement, for example, police leaders must develop and instill high standards in other officers to work toward the same goal. Beyond leadership, criminal justice relies on managers to optimize processes and lead efforts toward reliable outcomes. Generally, criminal justice leaders",
        "Environment-friendly technologies develop with the growing social awareness about the issues caused by pesticides utilization in various industries. Sharma et al. (2020) claim that \u201cthese chemicals enter the ecosystem, thus hampering the sensitive environmental equilibrium through bio-accumulation\u201d (p. 110812). Consequently, alternative strategies become in demand for protecting the plants and species from biomagnification and severe changes in natural settings (Sharma et al., 2020). Biological, semi-chemical, and physical control methods for decreasing the use of pesticides require proper encouragement to achieve sustainable improvement in the ecological situation. Indeed, the governmental programs, legislative changes, and business initiatives that promote environmental protection are the key for the novelties' implementation. There are several ways to influence the decision-making processes of pesticides used in the industries such as farming and livestock. Firstly, the awareness about the hazardous effect on human organisms must be increased through public health programs or social events. Knowledge about the diseases their pesticides users can develop in their family members would force them to take responsibility in a more efficient way than reminding them about the consequences to occur in decades (Magarey et al., 2019). Secondly, legislators and government can produce",
        "Motivation is the process whereby an individual's endeavors are stimulated, guided, and maintained toward achieving a goal. Thus, the responsibility of management is to monitor and direct workers in a company (Usmonovich, 2021). This is required since it is a method of inducing individuals to work, which they are capable and equipped to do freely. Even though most people have to work for a livelihood and a job is an essential part of everyone's lives, administrators must be apprehensive about employee motivation concerns for various reasons. Managers have several valid reasons to be concerned about motivating employees. Firstly, individual success in a company is viewed as a product of talent and inspiration. Additionally, the ability is influenced by education, expertise, and learning, and its development is a difficult and laborious process, whereas motivation may be accelerated (Usmonovich, 2021). Thus, employee motivation is widely recognized as critical to a corporation's success. In addition, a business that struggles with staff motivation is more likely to experience lower output, defective manufacturing, or other problems, and managers must guarantee that this does not happen (Usmonovich, 2021). Secondly, an administrator's role in the company is to get tasks completed through staff. In order to sustain desired objectives, thus, leaders need to be able to notice the decreasing",
        "Feminist ethics is founded on the views that women's subordination is morally inappropriate and that women's moral experiences are as valuable as men's. Vaughn (2019) states that the following are the practical aims of feminist ethics. Firstly, feminist ethics express moral critiques of behaviors and attitudes that reinforce women's rights. Consequently, the vital goal is to provide morally reasonable means to oppose such behaviors and practices. Ultimately, feminist ethics' objective is to imagine a morally good alternative that promotes female empowerment. Feminist ethical argument resurfaced in the late 1960s, first among the general public and then in academic discourse, as part of a broader rebirth of feminist ethical questions. On issues like abortion, fairness and equality, domestic work, sexual violence, and obligatory heterosexuality, the first academic feminist ideas were expressed. Nonetheless, the term \u2018feminist ethics' did not become widely used until the late 1970s or early 1980s (Vaughn, 2019). Traditional ethics, feminists speculated, was more thoroughly male-biased and required more radical reconsideration. Moreover, feminism is continuously engaged in ethical thought and discussion. According to Vaughn (2019), feminism is primarily a normative viewpoint, and feminists themselves regularly challenge its meaning. Lack of care",
        "The concept of culture is a fundamental phenomenon influencing all spheres of human life. It influences people's actions, methods, and approaches toward specific tasks and daily interactions. Thus, Roseberry determines culture as a socially constructed and socially constitutive part of the context where all activities take place. It means that all other fundamental institutions and phenomena, such as power, economy, and history, comprise the culture. At the same time, being the way of life, it influences the mentioned spheres and preconditions for the emergence of critical processes in these domains. In other words, peculiarities of culture influence decision-making in political processes and historical events which took place at different stages of society's evolution. Furthermore, the approaches to business in particular, and economy in general, depend on the values and visions peculiar to a bearer of a particular culture. For this reason, by understanding history and politics, it is possible to understand this unique notion and its layers. Rosebery also assumes that culture is socially constituted, meaning that many cultures share the same visions and values. For example, my own culture is similar to the culture of my friends and the people surrounding me as we live within the same context and share similar approaches. However, at the global level, my system",
        "In the modern world, diverse communities exist that support families in situations of emergency or need. Such support should be granted as sometimes families cannot manage their problems alone. Many communities provide families with support in diverse areas such as foster care, early childhood care, education, and homeless services (Fuss et al., 2021). For example, during the pandemics of COVID-19 many families experienced financial problems due to the ubiquitous job loss. Many such families could not cover their medical costs or even afford to buy normal food. Several organizations help families by caring about their young children or teenagers, providing them with psychological and economic help (Liebenberg et al., 2020). In such situations, to heighten or support the living standard and living conditions, communities can help families by providing them with food, accommodation, financial help, or help them find jobs. In addition, online communities can be supportive and useful for many families. For example, in situations of grief, people can support each other online or offline; however, grief support will need new approaches due to COVID-19 (Moore et al., 2020). Communities living in one district can help families with fires in their flats by sharing blankets, food, and water or by finding a place to live. Moreover, diverse populations or communities supporting families",
        "Social media has become an integral part of the modern world, considering that many people opt to use these platforms to interact with others. Personally, I prefer to use Facebook as it is not flooded with spam and advertisement as much as Instagram, Tik Tok, or similar apps. I use Facebook to interact with my old friends, who I can no longer see because they moved to other cities or even countries, so this social platform seems a perfect option to interact with them from time to time. However, mainstream social media applications appear to have influenced today's society since people are constantly exposed to hate, negative comments or publications, and fake influencers. To elaborate, impression management theory has become real since people try to become their better selves just to make a good impression on people they meet online. This fake image on social media can harm a person's self-esteem as people may feel insecure compared to the influencers' or supermodels' content on social platforms. Goffman's theory on social exchange is also apparent in the modern world, considering that people tend to quickly end relationships with people that seem to be of no benefit to them (Barbalet, 2020). Based on the aforementioned concepts, it is apparent that social media nowadays is entirely fake and toxic to users since it worsens their mental health and self-esteem. However, the abundance of social media platforms presents numerous",
        "The airline industry has been hit particularly hard by Covid 19. The virus outbreak has caused the governments of most countries to implement restrictions on traveling (Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aviation, 2022). Thus, the regulatory implementations have negatively affected the standard revenue, business practices, and practices of airline companies. First, passengers were less keen to travel due to the testing regulations, limited resources, and the lack of need to travel for work. Another cause was the regulation themselves that implied a reduction in Covid-19 cases through quarantine measures. The low demand has caused the airlines to lose revenue ($372 bn), which was an unprecedented change in the industry (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021). Flights were being canceled, and employees were laid off due to the challenging situation in which the corporations could not sustain airports with such a low passenger rate. The airline companies have experienced major economic challenges that have been facilitated by all the negative implications of the pandemic on civil aviation. As a result, fewer seats were being offered (-50%), and fewer passengers were able to travel via plane (-2,7 bn) (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021). The effect was slightly balanced out due to the fact that cargo flights have been less impacted or even increased in rates due to the transportation",
        "There are multiple factors that stand behind the successful implementation of the P-O-L-C framework. It is important to prioritize some of them duly in case a company faces serious issues, or when the market indicates upcoming challenges. The collapse of WorldCom in 2002, that led to one of the largest accounting scandals in the US, provides a nice example of the lack of proper communication in a corporation. The inability of various top managers and accountants to communicate efficiently in order to prevent frauds is always disastrous. WorldCom grew rapidly under Bernard Ebbers who managed to jump at the multiple opportunities that the growing interest for telecom services provided at that time. Nevertheless, the company went bankrupt in a matter of a few years. Moreover, Ebbers faced several charges, including one count of conspiracy, one count of securities fraud and seven counts of filing false statements with securities regulators. The fact that the large portion of Ebber's wealth was in WorldCom stocks, let alone several loans and loan guarantees from the company, was also scrutinized. The top managers of the company faced numerous charges and started to testify against each other. Moreover, Ebbers and his",
        "Bandung Conference was the first encounter between Asian and African countries that had gained independence from the western colonies. President of Indonesia Suharto invited the leaders from developing countries to Bandung, leading to a declaration on anti-imperialism and peaceful coexistence. It was hoped to unite emerging nations through collaboration in reducing their reliance on Europe and America. The conference aimed to promote Afro-Asian economic cultural cooperation and reject neocolonialism. The fundamental principles of the meeting were to respect territorial integrity and sovereignty, refrain from the use of power, have peaceful ways of settling disputes, and non-interference among the states. This nonaligned movement was founded to keep members from taking a side in Cold War politics, creating a solid rebellion. The outcome of the Bandung conference was that most of the Southeast Asian nations joined the agreement leading to the end of the Cold War. In addition, the Afro-Asian countries gained the opportunity to have a voice in world affairs, such as the representation of the Global South. The freedom to join the USA and the USSR Camp by the developing countries was achieved through the Bandung Conference (Lewis and Stolte, 2019). Although the movement aimed at discouraging members from participating in the War politics of the superpowers, most of the South and Southeast Asian countries were dragged into the Cold War In conclusion, the Afro-Asian conference, which represented twenty-nine nations from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, condemned colonialism, racism, and",
        "The first half of Imitation of Life deals with the question from a feminist perspective of what it means to be a woman living in a male-dominated society, while the second half deals with how women of color are affected by racism. Heung notes that it is a story about imitation and pretending to be untrue. Lora Meredith, a white woman, widow, and aspiring actress, always pretends. The motive for this behavior is to avoid the hassle of raising his only daughter, Susie, alone with very little money. Although Lora defies stereotypes by not letting any man control her or interfere with her success, she upholds the proper standards of a good mother. In turn, Susie's imitation of life is how she pretends to be a daughter, receiving all the love and affection from someone other than her mother while at the same time desperately showing her love to a man whose love is unrequited. Another heroine, Sarah Jane Johnson, spends her entire life imitating, pretending to be white when she is actually black. Annie Johnson, Sarah Jane's mother, is a black woman who lives her life with the feeling of always seeing herself through the eyes of others. Thus, all these female characters are role models in their performances. An exception is",
        "It is important to note that the decision-making process is a complex and highly intricate activity, which involves the accuracy of the information, a clear vision of objectives, and an understanding of the underlying issues. Errors in the decision-making process are common and can be done by any manager. However, there is a clear distinction between a bad decision and a wrong decision. In the case of the latter, the decision is the result of reliance on false or inaccurate information with the best intentions to make a correct choice. When it comes to a bad decision, a manager is aware of and has accurate information and a proper understanding of key factors but intentionally chooses the incorrect path. A bad decision might occur due to a wide range of factors, which can involve a conflict between a manager's self-interests and organizational objectives or merely emotional influence on the decision-making. However, wrong decisions require changes in the acquisition of accurate and reliable information on which the correct decision can be made. In both cases, it is highly relevant to improve one's decision-making skills both now and in the future. Such an improvement requires an increase in the integrity of processes of data acquisition and collection. It is stated that decisions can be \u201cimpaired by",
        "The process of forming states is not characterized by ease. It involves many different processes, including cultural strategies of strength. It is believed that this aspect in the form of actions of social agents is of particular importance. This is because they occupy a central place in such processes as the formation of alliances and the establishment of dominance relations. Understanding this concept can give a better understanding of the creation of Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India. First, it is necessary to understand what a social strategy of power is and what significance it has. Thus, it is defined as a particular area of practice where the creators of mass media have cultural influences and act as agents of social change. Thus, these sources form and influence public opinion, which may affect the formation of states. Gledhill emphasizes that the main reason for the difference between state and stateless societies is the centralization and non-centralization of power. Thus, the absence of the second aspect is expressed in inequality, and the absence of citizenship is associated with decentralization and vice versa with equality. Therefore, in conclusion, to understand the emergence of the state in the case of Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India, it is necessary to consider the culture strategy of power. Therefore, the author makes an attempt to distance from the generally accepted European principles and",
        "Culture is the entirety of social norms, behaviors, and customs which distinguish a certain society from the rest of the world. Naturally, some cultures have common features, thus forming cultural clusters. At the same time, leadership is a personality trait that transcends national boundaries. This does not imply that all people with power behave in the same manner, as leaders are also influenced by cultural norms. Behavior differences are evident in the way people in different clusters view time. Middle Eastern cultures are frequently juxtaposed to Western ones, particularly American. Beehner writes that while \u201cmost Middle Eastern nations are past oriented\u201d and uphold traditions, \u201cmany Americans believe they can control the future and embrace change for the sole purpose of changing\u201d (72). Barak Obama is an example of a leader who gained prominence by articulating the importance of change. The list of differences in leadership behaviors is not limited to the perception of the future. Crede et al. have conducted a study in which they ascertain cultural differences in relation to transformational leadership. (23). The most peculiar finding is that \u201ctransformational leadership exhibits stronger relationships with subordinate performance in cultures with low levels of gender egalitarianism values\u201d (Crede et al. 23).

        "The suggested strategies to mitigate the effects of coronavirus in accordance with the example of Iceland could be considered as an interesting approach. This strategy acknowledges its apparent limitations, such as the resilience of the Iceland community, geographical idiosyncrasy. However, currently, this strategy might not be a valid method to address the high margins of infected individuals in NATO countries. It is certainly true that quick response and high testing rates would contribute to the deterrence of the effects imposed by the sudden growth of the number of infected. However, it is similarly meaningful that the population would be willing to undergo such a measure. Moreover, despite the financial support efforts, some countries belonging to the organization might not be able to financially withstand the high amount of testing imposed by the new waves of infection. This fact is especially relevant given that the virus dissemination might emerge across several countries simultaneously. Therefore, a different approach to the problem might be necessary. The Israeli government approached the problem of monitoring the infected with the creative solution of digital epidemiological investigation (Amit et al., 2020). This technology allowed tracking potential contacts of people that were infected and act accordingly (Amit et al., 2020). However, it is arguable that this methodology could address the geographical limitations introduced in the case of Iceland. It would be difficult",
        "The rapidly changing situation in the market of goods and services forces organizations to adapt efficiently and quickly. It results in overly rapid changes within the enterprise without a smooth transition. The fast pace is becoming a problem for both the company and employees. Team members are forced to quickly adapt to new work formats, promptly learn new skills, and take on additional roles. In such conditions, competent and high-quality change management and decision-making are essential. In an age of global transformation, change management has become one of the principal success factors for most companies. The surrounding reality is in a state of constant shift: the demands of internal and external customers are changing, new market barriers and opportunities are emerging, unforeseen risks are occurring. Companies that cannot withstand the pace of development and adapt to new conditions often have to leave the market, giving way to more flexible organizations. The central concern is that for most employees, rapid change causes a feeling of anxiety and discomfort. It often causes longer sick days, days off, constant complaints, and employee turnover. People are distressed about their jobs, an unknown future, and ever-increasing competition (Anastasiou, 2020). The situation can be aggravated by the inability to master new technologies, the lack of high-quality communication, and a sick work environment that negatively affects the overall progress. The decision-making process can be challenging, especially in times of crisis. The crisis is a severe external factor that significantly affects the quality of conclusions.",
        "The two American regions to be first settled by the English colonists were New England and the Chesapeake Bay. In the Chesapeake Bay, the colonists arrived under the auspices of Virginia Company \u2013 a joint-stock enterprise dedicated to colonizing America for profit. Although the early hopes of finding precious metals did not materialize, the region eventually found its economic specialization in growing tobacco (Corbett et al., 2022). The company hired the English poor for the labor-intensive task of growing the colony and producing tobacco, and most of the newcomers were young single males (Corbett et al., 2022). Conversely, the New England colonies followed a different settlement pattern. Unlike the Chesapeake Bay, they were shaped not by the pursuit of profit but by the desire to escape persecution and perceived moral decadence of England and create a virtuous society (Corbett et al., 2022). New Englanders came to America as entire families and, unlike the Chesapeake Bay colonists, established a largely self-sustaining economy of farms, hamlets, and commercial enterprises rather than cash crop plantations (Corbett et al., 2022). Such were the differences in settlement patterns and shaping forces between the two. Religion played a considerable role in both regions, although in the shape of different denominations.

The company has adapted its strategy to each market with precision, flexibility, and creativity that made its products highly recognized. The ingenuity of its marketing mix proposal can serve as an example for other companies in Europe and worldwide. In this paper, the four components of IKEA's marketing mix will be discussed. This Swedish company has gained renown for the quality, accessibility, and innovativeness of its products. First of all, the firm's pricing strategy is focused on affordability, as the structure and logistics of its stores are optimized for a maximum price reduction (O'Neill, 2021). Promotions of this store chain are widespread through all communication channels, ranging from local radio stations to social media accounts made for each region individually. IKEA stays on top of modern advertising strategies and employs influencers to reach younger audiences (O'Neill, 2021). Regarding its locations, IKEA continuously selects places where it will remain accessible for the public while keeping its prices at the lowest. However, the most notable feature of this company is its products. Its home furniture is easy to recognize for its style, modularity, and reusability (O'Neill, 2021).

        "\u201cFences\u201d by American playwright August Wilson was published in 1987. This play is about an elderly scavenger Troy, a basketball star in his youth. It is worth mentioning that \u201cFences\u201d contains many essential topics for discussion which are relevant nowadays. For instance, the first scene reveals the duties and responsibilities of fathers and sons. There are many interpretations of \u201cFences,\u201d including staged and filmed versions, and it is important to discuss both to understand their features. The spectator sees James Earl Jones in the role of a strict father. His son, Lyons, is trying to figure out whether his father loves him, which constitutes one of this scene's essences. It is vital to say that each of the three versions, movie, play, and text, is unique, and the spectator perceives it differently. For instance, Lyons, the son, asks his father about Troy's affection for him. Indeed, he does not receive an expectable answer. Instead of confessing in love, Troy explains what it means to be a father. \u201cIt is my duty to take care of you\u201d is a strong phrase that shows another variety of fatherly love (Niko Papastefanou, 2011). The excerpt from the play demonstrates Troy almost in anger; probably, he is unfamiliar with tender feelings, but he knows how to take responsibility for his family. The 2016 movie \u201cFences\u201d shows the same scene, but it is perceived differently. Here, the dialogue between Troy and",
        "Levels of culture can be displayed in different planes and depths. According to Edgar Shein, who developed the concept \u2018levels of organizational culture,' and Edward Granter who later expanded on this concept, the culture of the entity can be seen in four levels: super-structural, symbolic, discursive, and cognitive (Granter, 2019). In other words, the levels of culture in enterprises are developed due to external economic and social influences, artifacts such as logos, story rituals and events, values explicitly expressed by the organization, and underlying assumptions. This paper aims to assess the levels of organizational culture for Macomb Community College. Artifacts in Macomb Community College show that it promotes concentration, attentiveness, and responsibility, which is reflected in the logo. Looking at the architecture of the buildings, some of which use chrome-plated modern high-tech structures, one can assume that technology and science are the main focus of educational programs. Nonetheless, the central older building and a park with large trees create an atmosphere of solitude and introspection, which is more in line with the study of fine arts and social sciences. Equally important, the college has a high culture of mutual help and respect and cherishes community relations, which is reflected in the developed bus route system available to students. On the value level, many signs within the college, including parking signs, library signs,",
        "The article highlighted multiple reasons why women chose to be child-free. These include the desire to succeed from an academic and professional perspective, financial reasons, a lack of natural desires, and the understanding that a child would not enhance their life but rather make it more difficult (Sandler). There were a couple of things that I can't entirely agree with. The choice of a woman to be in a serious relationship with a man with a 15-year-old daughter without taking even minimal parental responsibilities appears to be inconsiderate for the young girl both from the perspective of the childfree woman and the father who accepts such conditions. Moreover, the statement that women are not more pressured into having children due to the possibilities does not correlate with the previous standards in which women who did not get married and have children had almost no opportunities in society. Based on the materials I have read, I would say that being child-free is a choice that everyone can make depending on the life goals and aspirations of the person. On the one hand, a woman may be happy building a solid career and not have any desire to make changes for a child, which makes it unreasonable to have one unless love and care can be provided. On the other hand,",
        "The devastation and challenges of World War II were tremendous. The U.S. faced severe and significant objectives that would define the future state of America and European countries. It was essential for the U.S. to oppose Communist expansion in Europe and Asia, so there were specific policies that addressed this aim, and evaluating their efficiency and success may provide valuable insights. First, it is essential to discuss the policy of containment that was adopted by America and its allies. The purpose of this strategy was to prevent the spread of communism and respond to the Soviet Union's moves to expand its influence in a number of countries by providing struggling nations with more funding (Corbett et al., 2014). It is possible to say that this policy was effective because the U.S. managed to protect several countries from being coerced into communism. The second successful policy is the Marshall Plan aimed at several positive changes. The main idea behind this policy was to provide financial support to the struggling European nations, giving them $13 billion in economic aid (Corbett et al., 2014). The countries that received financial help were united and managed to undercut the political popularity of communism. The third relatively successful reform was the Vietnam conflict (\u201cDomino theory,\u201d 2018). In this war, South Vietnam and the U.S. acted",
        "Melanoma is generally recognized as one of the cancers that have an increasing cover percentage, though it is usually diagnosed at early stages. Recently, the ways of melanoma treatment for patients with metastatic disease were so limited that many patients were practically doomed. Fortunately, melanoma therapeutics have developed for the past decade because of the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Now, people with stages II and III may easily have a long period of remission. Therefore, modern options for melanoma treatment serve as a source of hope for numerous people. Indeed, innovations in the sphere of melanoma treatment are connected with the use of checkpoint inhibitors and the so-called adjuvant therapy. According to recent research, \u201cthe use of anti\u2013CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitors and combination BRAF/MEK inhibitors for patients with BRAF V600 mutations has significantly extended survival and allowed some patients to remain in durable disease remission off therapy\u201d (Poklepovic & Luke, 2019, p. 1166). This means that the so-called \u201clow-risk\u201d patients with stage IIA through IIC melanoma like Mr. B. from the question may have a long remission after receiving a special course. Still, patients in remission should better keep healthy with adjuvant therapies. A decade ago, such kind of additional treatment was frequently considered of marginal effects for earlier stage melanoma because of interferon-\u03b12b (IFN). It turned out that",
        "Considerable musicians have represented soul music, and James Brown was one of the most prominent. Southern soul became extremely popular towards the end of the 1960s, and Brown had his first success in 1956 (Covach and Flory 218). Initially, Brown worked as a stand-in for Little Richard, and his first record, \u201cPlease Please Please,\u201d was quite thriving (Covach and Flory 240-241). Brown used to sing lead vocals, and his early musical style resembled that of the 1950s doo-wop (Covach and Flory 242). However, he began to develop the soul style in 1960 with \u201cThink,\u201d characterized by horns and a driving rhythm section (Covach and Flory 242). In 1964, Brown introduced \u201cOut of Sight,\u201d which represented the hard-driving soul style featured in his later songs towards the 1970s (Covach and Flory 242). James Brown was one of the performers who took control of their music, as he united an aggressive style of vocal and dance performance, production skills, and understanding of business (Covach and Flory 242). Brown's musical style through the 1960s and into the 1970s changed from following prior era's themes to creating his unique sounds. As Brown was searching for and evolving his individual style, his career differed from Motown, Stax, or Atlantic artists and led him to produce distinguishable songs. For instance, the stops at the end of the verses in Brown's \u201cPapa's Got a Brand New Bag, Pt. 1\u201d distinct the music from a Stax arrangement (Covach and Flory 243). At the same time, the absence of background vocals in the song",
        "In the history of mankind, the computer has become one of the most important inventions. Hardly anyone can imagine a modern home or office without computers. While some people argue that the computer has provided us with additional conveniences, according to others, the computer has made our life more complex and stressful. I believe that computers, in the first place, have enriched our society with several advantages due to faster communication and easier access to information. The computer provides us with a fast way to communicate. In our time, when modern society is becoming more global, computers play an essential role in communication systems. Previously, communication was limited to means such as mail (Grudin, 2017). If a businessman traveled abroad, the sending of reports and reports, as a rule, was accompanied by significant delays. Since the competitiveness of a business depends on time, this situation was completely unacceptable. The Internet has allowed businesses to send messages instantly. Staff can send emails or instant messages to a manager anywhere in the world (Grudin, 2017). This has added efficiency to businesses and expanded business opportunities. For me, a computer is a technological necessity that makes my life more enjoyable and interesting. First of all, a computer is an excellent leisure tool. Watching movies and various sci-fi programs through my electronic companion is very convenient",

        "It goes without saying that Beowulf may be regarded as one of the most prominent ancient European poems. Although its origin remains the subject of multiple discussions, the common version describes it as \u201ca Danish poem in the Anglo-Saxon dialect\u201d (Neidorf 847). The poem describes the glorious life and deeds of a hero, Beowulf, who was regarded as a person sent by heaven for people (Gummere line 13). Helping Hrothgar, king of the Danes, he kills the monster Grendel and his mother. Later, when he becomes the king of Danes by himself, he has to fight a dragon that terrorizes his lands. Although he follows the beast and finally slays it, Beowulf dies, being mortally wounded. From a personal perspective, this poem reflects several essential aspects of human life. The first one is the issue of identity \u2013 in Beowulf, people were entirely associated with the glory of their ancestors. They do not exist independently from their family lineage and kinship bonds. Thus, their desire of Beowulf to be recognizable and honored forces him to search for deeds and fame. Thus, another important theme of the poem is the maturity and responsibility that come with age. At the beginning of the poem, the main hero desires personal glory and has nothing to lose. However, after becoming",
        "The reason for the military conflict between the United States and Spain was the American government's support for the Cubans' long battle for independence from the Spanish crown. The US invasion of Cuba became evident when the USS \u201cMaine\u201d sank under mysterious conditions in the waters of Havana. Around the same time, in February 1898, hasty preparations for war began, while the Spaniards were accused in absentia of undermining the battleship (Mortenson & Springer, 2019). In general, one can talk about a long-term political game with Spain, in which several provocations tightened relations with the country on the eve of the war. The liberation of Cuba seemed like a financially attractive prospect for the US and provided strategic advantages. In addition, the American empire was then just gaining momentum and already had a successful experience in appropriating other territories of the Western Hemisphere (Kagan, 2019). The American government portrayed the unleashed war as a battle for the interests of Cuba and relied on the facts of human rights violations to legitimize military action. In April, a ten-week war began in which the United States defeated the Spanish army and navy. Under the Treaty of Paris in 1898, the United States gained control of the island. In 1899, the island was occupied, and a few years later, the government received permission to place naval bases. The position",
        "This paper will provide an analysis of the article \u201cCOVID-19: Impact on Nurses and Nursing\u201d by Fauteux (2021). The abstract is supposed to be the opening of the article. It is a way to quickly introduce the reader to the results of the research. In this article, the abstract is a brief overview of the topic that will be discussed. However, it contains no information about the methods of the research or its results. On this basis, such an abstract cannot be called comprehensive. The article's introduction is already more extensive, offering a general overview of the topic. It provides information that the times of coronavirus pandemic have affected nursing. In addition, the introduction has statistics, which introduce the reader to the subject in a tangible way. From the introduction, I learned about the general factors of COVID's effect on nursing, including increased mortality, changes in work practices, and increased workload. This introduction can be considered extensive and adequate. The research method of this article is qualitative in that a review of a body of research draws empirical conclusions. These conclusions relate to the significant changes that have occurred in nursing and its nature. The study uses quantitative data that has already been processed and presents an overview of information previously analyzed. The result of the study is the identification of the main factors of change in nursing. These include the intensification of collaboration and innovation, the removal of practice barriers, the popularization of telemedicine, and the increased risks of burnout (Fauteux, 2021). I learned how much nursing has been affected by the pandemic.",
        "The issue of tribal sovereignty has been scrutinized over the years, the treatment of tribes ranging from supportive measures and attempts of integration into the broader community to outright persecution. In this connection, the law about tribal gaming can be seen as a positive step towards recognition of tribes' unique way of life and self-determination. This essay discusses the question \u201chow tribal gaming act can add to the sovereignty of tribes?\u201d Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes were given the right to determine what gaming activities they wanted to engage in, and in most cases, the permission was granted by the state. Gaming activities could embrace tribal rituals or games of chance, depending on the wishes of the tribes and had to be agreed to by the state (Light and Rand). Since often tribal games are unique and have a deep meaning for the tribe, it would be right to say that granting tribes the right to hold their own games is necessary. This measure helps to uphold their culture and establish sovereignty over a very important sphere of life, which is relaxation. Moreover, gaming helps to support traditions and customs through rituals that have been molded over the centuries. As far as sovereignty",
        "Developing a contract so that all parties involved could be aware of their obligations and meet them accordingly is one of the vital tasks for an organization. Charles Schwab, an organization offering banking and brokerage services, has developed a contract for its users to sign so that both parties could meet the respective requirements (Reder et al., 2021). For their collaboration. Since the contract in question contains the essential components of a legal agreement, it can be considered viable. Starting with the key definitions of the foundational concepts on which the agreement is based, Schwab's contract establishes the offer, acceptance, and legality terms from the start exceptionally clearly. The specified clarity and transparency benefit the company and its customers, promoting immediate trust and cooperation (Templin, 2017). Remarkably, Schwab also provides a robust basis for the consideration element of the agreement. Namely, the contract outlines the legal issues associated with the disbursement process, as well as the associated trading concerns (\u201cSchwab account agreement,\u201d 2022). Outlining that Schwab is not responsible for tracking the trading process, the contract sets the key responsibilities and relations between the parties completely clearly. Incorporating the primary components of a legal contract, the brokerage agreement created by Schwab offers its customers a chance to familiarize themselves closely with the services that they will obtain and the responsibilities that they have. Similarly, the contract outlines the crucial responsibilities of Schwab, thus, creating a basis",
        "The study showed that bibliometric analysis of evidence gathered from integrative reviews and analytical studies had substantial implications for nurse-related and evidence based policy changes. Primarily, this is possible through the use of integrative reviews in designing new programs (Benton et al., 2020). The collective database of the synthesized studies as suggested by the authors of the study, can be utilized by nurses to be empowered through evidence-based materials in the formulation of changes in universal health coverage. As such, the applicability of this information has a number of benefits for working nurses, as they will be able to employ concise and trusted resources when advocating or implementing changes to policy. I think that nursing practice can be vastly improved with the use of well-managed databases that employ evidence-based research. This is because such a database will be able to illustrate gaps in knowledge of overarching issues as well as daily medical practices in the sphere of nursing (Houser, 2016). Similarly, it allows for insight into nurse-specific fields such as nurse education, care for the lederly, emergency care, and more. Currently, accessibility to extensive and complete information that is formed through",
        "There is no simple answer to what it means to be human. Some might say that being human means being independent and controlling their personal lives. For other people, being human means utilizing the refinements of civilization, wearing clothes, and going to work every day, i.e., doing everything that animals cannot do. It is also complicated to say how people want to live because everyone has unique requirements, dreams, and thoughts on this issue. This essay reflects on the On Being podcast and answers the above questions. In the podcast, Thich Nhat Hanh explains why people need to be human. According to him, \u201cwe have to remain human to be able to understand and to be compassionate\u201d (Onbeing.org 30:53 \u2013 30:58). The monk adds that being human means having a right to make mistakes, but the absence of a \u201cright to continue making mistakes\u201d (Onbeing.org 31:15 \u2013 31:20). Therefore, being human means being mindful, responsible, and open-hearted. In other words, being human is about being humane. People live in a world of violence and terror and cannot even talk to each other effectively (Onbeing.org). Consequently, they fail to understand which way of living is genuine. From the words of Thich Nhat Hanh, it could be inferred that people want to live without",
        "Unemployment is a significant social and economic problem. Not always positive aspects of enterprise development contribute to a decrease in the percentage of unemployed. The negative impact may be cumulative along with phenomena such as inflation external factors, including the pandemic. Difficulties in obtaining an education for low-income families only widen the gap between the rich and the poor, which in America is already the largest in the world (Telford, 2019). Consequently, the leading causes of unemployment are inflation, advanced technology, and lack of education or skills for employment. Inflation drives up prices in the economy. Naturally, the price of both products and the materials they have produced increases. Employers seek to recoup the costs of inflation by constantly increasing the financial performance of sales. One of these methods is to increase the gross profit ratio by reducing the cost of production. As a result, the company seeks to optimize costs by reducing wages and saving on various employee benefits. This unfair practice leads to layoffs. One",
        "Swimmer Lia Thomas attended the University of Pennsylvania as a student. In 2021, the media focused on her successes in sports as a trans woman. Lia Thomas, a first-time competitor in the women's division, had a strong showing. Early in December, she had her greatest college results of the year in Ohio, when she competed in the two hundred and five hundred meter sprints. After Lia Thomas' successes at university swimming pools, she was criticized following the fact that she was born a male, which gave him an advantage. Some people argued that because Thomas was taking testosterone therapy, he had an unfair advantage over other athletes. Describing her victory to be unfair was completely wrong following the fact that trans genders are always allowed to compete by themselves. Various suggestions have been put up, including the creation of a transsexual division in the NCAA if trans individuals have such an unfair edge. Men compete with men, women compete with women, and transsexuals compete against one another. Thomas's success in the past seasons is a testament to his hard work and dedication. He has shown that transgender athletes can also be as successful as anyone else and should be respected for their achievements. However, the fact is that Thomas has been subject to all the same testing and regulations as any other",
        "Outreach Chicago is an organization providing help and services to homeless people and those underserved by already existing incorporations. The company's main mission is to provide help and necessities to humans for their subsequent successful reintegration into society. To practice deductive reasoning, it is essential to start by formulating a general hypothesis or statement that Outreach Chicago provides help to people (Adler & Clark, 2015). The observation allows us to find evidence for the statement as Outreach Chicago serves meals and distributes hygiene kits, coats, blankets, socks, and undergarments to people in need. The company's official site provides precise numbers of each aid type, so one can conclude that the company indeed provides help with various necessities since 2011 to people in need. Outreach Chicago states the average poverty rate in its area of performance is 34% among adults and 51% among children (Outreach Chicago, 2022). To practice inductive reasoning, it might be useful to compare data stated by the company with the other statistical sources regarding poverty rates, checking the modernity",
        "The healthcare industry typically draws sufficient attention to patients' education, especially when it comes to representatives of minority groups. That is why the article by McCurley et al. (2017) offers valuable information. The researchers demonstrate that Hispanic individuals deal with improved diabetes prevention when they participate in individual and group face-to-face sessions (McCurley et al., 2017). I believe that there is an apparent reason why such positive outcomes are achieved. It seems that face-to-face interventions are effective because patients have an opportunity to ask questions if they require explanations. Simultaneously, such educational sessions demonstrate that a patient is not unique with such a health issue. As a result, such interventions can improve people's morale, which, in turn, will lead to increased motivation to take preventive measures and protect health. This information allows for supposing that face-to-face interventions can be suitable to my practicum project that considers measures to improve access to care among African Americans with heart failure diseases. However, the focus on patients' cultural backgrounds should not lead to ignoring a broader context. This statement refers to the findings by Cajiita et al.

        "Since it is assumed that skiing is a rather traumatic sport, the company should have taken precautions for minimizing the injury risks for the skiers. However, in that particular case, the actions of the company's workers have created risks for health damage for Mr. Craig and Mr. Alex, who were actually injured. The fact that it was April and the slopes were supposed to be closed may lessen the degree of the company's responsibility in this particular case, but not completely. The company made a mistake letting people ski after the snowstorm though it could not have allowed people to do it. Hence, the company's actions endangered not only the skiers but the staff as well. Though Mr. Alex's injury was made by Mr. Craig, it is not only his responsibility in its causation. It would not have happened if Dan and Abby did not send him to the untested slope without any instructor who could have prevented Mr. Alex's injury. Hence, the health damage was caused both by the company and by Mr. Craig unwillingly. However, it does not mean that the compensation for Mr. Alex's injury is a part of Mr. Craig's responsibility since his actions were the result of the actions of Dan and Abby. Thus, the company should compensate Mr. Alex's treatment costs relying on the severity of the damage he has experienced and the length of the recovery period (Goguen, n.d.). Apart from that,",
        "Service marketing is usually defined as a promotion of an intangible good or a service to a particular segment of the audience. It is distinguished from product marketing by such features as Inseparability, Heterogeneity, Intangibility, and Perishability. This paper will focus on the last characteristic, perishability, which implies the impossibility of any storage or repeated use of the service. In case the service is not used, it is most likely to be lost forever (Hole et al., 2018). Examples of such can be a concert or a sports event. Sometimes they can be canceled either by a performing party or by a consumer. In this case, the service does not take place at all. Perishability also underlines a limited time of their use, which is usually specified. For instance, a concert of classical music which lasts for two hours. Because of these time constraints, the consumers can reasonably demand more from the services than from the products. Another implication of this feature from the marketing perspective is the difficulties in regulation of supply and demand as it is rather unpredictable. Moreover, in case of poor marketing, economic losses are guaranteed. An example could be not a fully loaded plane or fifty percent of unsold tickets for a concert. As the service still occurs despite these facts, a part of the revenue will be lost. Also, the services cannot be returned in case of a consumer's dissatisfaction in contrast to other commodities \u2013 it is also the feature of perishability. Thus, it also leads to",
        "Care ethics theory was thoroughly criticized based on the concept of slave morality. This idea was developed by Nietzsche and declares that discriminated people often create the mindset that enables them to treat their forced servant behavior as a kind of virtuous manners (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, n.d.). Thus, the urge and readiness to provide care are viewed not as a positive trait but lowliness that only strengthens oppression. The other criticism of care ethics lies in the notion that provided help is often parochial. Namely, the caregivers prefer their relatives, friends, and the citizens of their country over other people who need support but are distant from the organized help centers (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, n.d.). Therefore, the accusing ones hold that caregivers are rather selective and provide their services only to the local elite. The contrast of reason and emotion is valuable for understanding care ethics. As Held (1997) declares, \u201ca genuinely universal \u2026 moral theory would be one that would take account of the experience and concerns of women as fully as it does the experience and concerns of men\u201d (p. 99).

        "Scott Kiesling focuses on the address term dude in the article Dude (2004), whereby the term's pattern of use, meanings, and functions are highlighted. The author is an American sociolinguist prompted to research dude's functions and implications in the American culture by his undying interests in gender and language. Dude portrays a specific pattern of use influenced by its societal functions and meanings, thus explaining its high usage and enhanced popularity. Dude is mostly used by the younger generation of European American men when addressing one another and partly by women. Kiesling (2004) reports that \u201c\u2026 dude is used primarily by men speaking to other men, but not exclusively so\u2026 young women also used the term a significant amount\u2026\u201d (p. 287, p. 284). Moreover, contextual and grammatical relevance determines the pattern of the usage of dude, including its intonation. Therefore, factors such as gender and location influence the degree of the use of dude. Dude has five interactional functions that overlap and illustrate how the term engulfs masculine homo-sociality. These functions are gesturing agreements, marking attachment and connection, marking the discourse structure, mitigating stances of confrontations, and exclamation (Kiesling, 2004). Dude can either be applied to more than a single function or be",
        "Aristotle made a discovery fundamental to all logic by introducing variables. Thus, it was shown that logic is not just a specific doctrine of specific things or terms, but the science of the laws of syllogisms, such as modus ponens or modus tollens, expressed in variables. Studying various judgments, formal logic abstracts from their specific content, revealing a structure common to objects of different content. Syllogism is the discovery of Aristotle and is the main and most original part of his logic. In the theory of syllogisms, Aristotle defined syllogism and distinguished its types, defined working and non-working types of syllogisms, and established three figures of syllogism. I find it particularly interesting that Aristotle was the first to make reasoning methods the subject of scientific research. He introduced the methods of reasoning as integral formations and not just certain reasoning components. Everything that was done in logic before Aristotle just attempted to understand individual methods and principles without any systematization and unification into a single coherent system. Thus, such concepts as Modus ponens and Modus tollens laid the foundation for understanding the definition of the truth of thinking. Thus, I am amazed at how accurately Aristotle introduced the concepts of conclusions that",
        "The current global landscape of the agricultural economy is composed of large companies. In fact, their presence is prevalent enough to dictate and formulate policies and standards within the industry (Chemnitz et al., 2017). In practice, this has resulted in a number of discrepancies such as environmental damages, violations of human and labor rights, and even the lack of effort to minimize poverty. While the scale of the issue may seem too large to resolve, alterations of consumer buying habits have the potential to foster diversity within such industries. However, buying habits are only a small fragment of a number of interventions that are necessary. Perhaps the most vital change that is missing includes government presence. The most interesting aspect of the reading to me was focused on how the current size of the agricultural market was attained. The most prominent driver of such expansion was technological advancements that led to fundamental changes within the institution of the agricultural economy. Because machines were able to harvest in abundant amounts compared to employees, this created a substantial raise within the supply component of the economy. Companies also gained the upper hand by being able to sell quantities of crops before they",
        "\u201cInterpreter of Maladies\u201d introduces the reader to a collapsing world of a dysfunctional family. In the novel, Mr. Das sparks both sympathy and a sense of slight annoyance that is likely to transform into disdain after considering the evolution of his character. Although the character might seem benevolent and sympathetic at first, his evident inability to emotionally connect with his wife or children indicates the need for further evolution, which never occurs. At first glance, Mr. Das represents a character that is easy to empathize with and relate to due to his kind nature. Indeed, Mr. Das is mostly benevolent and kind-hearted throughout the novel. For example, he is never aggressive or unkind to his wife, her mostly being the one to start a confrontation: \u201c'But they're harmless,' Mr. Das said\u201d (Lahiri). However, Mr. Das should not be seen as immediately redeemable. Specifically, on a closer look, Mr. Das' unwillingness to interact with his wife or children becomes evident. For instance, when Mr. Kapasi starts talking to the couple., Mr. Das chooses to avoid the conversation. Namely, he chooses to read a book instead: \u201cMr. Das was absorbed by his tour book, so it seemed like a private conversation between Mr. Kapasi and Mrs. Das\u201d (Lahiri). Therefore, Mr. Das clearly distances himself from his wife and, by extension, from his children, creating a further rift in their relationship. Therefore, the failure to acknowledge and address a",

This story is the mainstream paradigm for conservative media and has been told in different forms for years. The negative impacts of the \u201czero-sum\u201d paradigm on the United States are massive and diverse. This mindset created additional economic, political, and social costs for all citizens of the United States. One of the prominent examples demonstrated by McGhee is the history of public swimming pools in cities across the US. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were massive public swimming pools in many US cities, yet at that time \u201cpublic\u201d mostly meant \u201cwhite only\u201d pools. After numerous drowning incidents, local municipalities were told to open the pools for all people regardless of their race, which provoked a backlash from the white residents. As a result, cities preferred to close or privatize the public facilities instead of allowing people of different races to use them freely. This is an example of the destruction of public goods and a massive cost increase for the whole population due to the \u201czero-sum\u201d mindset. Another negative example demonstrated by McGhee is political in nature \u2013 many white people stopped pushing for social governmental policies",
        "One of the key aspects of the assessment includes risk analysis and goal setting, both of which enable a clearer direction and more detailed as well as the focused planning process. The video provides an insightful demonstration of how risk assessment and goal setting are conducted when dealing with a client. The assessment session begins with the risk assessment process, where a counselor asks a client whether or not he or she has suicidal thoughts. Regardless of the answer, the video shows that the counselor asks the client to report if she will start having such inclinations (Dr. Todd Grande, 2016). A similar structure is applied to tendencies of harming others with an equivalent request to report. The last part of the risk assessment includes questions about drug-related issues, such as hallucinations (Dr. Todd Grande, 2016). The goal setting process is initiated by questions regarding goals on the client's life in general, for which she responds with \u201cnice cushy job\u201d and \u201cbetter future for her children\u201d (Dr. Todd Grande, 2016). A more specific goal also needs to be identified, such as becoming drug free. The third part of goal setting involves objectives specifically for counseling itself, such as being less angry, sleeping more, eating less, and trying to quit drugs (Dr. Todd Grande, 2016). The confidence in achieving is also assessed, which",
        "The 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was introduced in the second half of the 19th century, manifesting the abolition of slavery across the country. According to the text, every citizen of the U.S. can neither enslave people nor be enslaved by fellow U.S. residents regardless of gender, race, age, or any other characteristic (U.S. Const. amend. 13, \u00a7 1). The abolition of slavery across the state has impacted U.S. history and the life of every American citizen, as this process initiated the restoration of individual freedom and nationwide democracy. Although currently, this Amendment does not have such a powerful impact on the everyday life of American citizens, it's phrasing implicitly affects the limitation of human freedom. The Amendment states that involuntary servitude is abolished except for the cases of criminal punishment, and the lack of further explanation of this phrase currently leads to high imprisonment rates among racial minorities in the U.S. The 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to vote to every American citizen regardless of racial affiliation (U.S. Const. amend. 15, \u00a7 1). Ratified back in 1870, this Amendment initiated a nationwide shift toward equality and the abolition of constitutional racism. Currently, nearly 15% of the U.S. population are Black, and securing their right to vote brings changes to",
        "Overpopulation in cities has become one of the most critical problems of our time. This is both an environmental and a social problem. The city cannot grow indefinitely and provide decent workplaces for every resident. The ecological burden is also increasing. Uncontrolled growth in the number of cities leads to the unchecked spread of pollution and the escalation of poverty. However, there are several preventive measures that the Government can implement to combat this problem. First of all, overpopulation in cities is congestion and traffic jams, which lead to serious pollution problems. Atmospheric pollution is the most serious in cities, and its primary source is road transport, which emits sulfur dioxide and nitrogen into the air in huge quantities. The second main problem is poverty: disadvantaged groups in rural areas live in poverty (Innes et al., 2019). Some of them decide to settle in the city because they believe that they can easily find work. Their main goal is to provide for their family, but almost none have the necessary education for a good job. These people come to the city and become a service class. They suffer from the prejudice of indigenous people, poverty, and",

This man is a famous astrophysicist and planetary scientist who shares his opinions and knowledge on various platforms. Personally, I find the pieces of information he provides mind-opening and shocking at times. I believe that this person knows a lot of controversial information and has various opinions on such matters, which would be pretty interesting to know. Neil deGrasse Tyson was born in 1958 and received several degrees from various universities, including Harvard, the University of Texas at Austin, and Columbia University (Tyson). Additionally, in early 2000, he was appointed by the president to serve on the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry (Culp). I am a person who has always been fond of the vast and mysterious cosmos. I have watched a lot of documentaries that shed light on the peculiarities of universes, galaxies, and planets. Among those documentaries was Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson. I believe that the knowledge of this astrophysicist stretches far beyond the information narrated in the documentary. If I had a chance to talk to this person, I would definitely ask him questions about extraterrestrial life. I have always found it perplexing that our planet is the only planet that has life, and I wonder if Tyson has any theories on this matter. I",
        "Individual freedoms and national security are sometimes seen as two opposites. However, in ideal, national security should reflect the balanced relationship between the two mentioned concepts. Moreover, the principle of the prevalence of individual freedoms over the national security underlies the democratic idea. Individual freedoms include individual rights and are protected by the US Constitution (Longley). This paper argues that individual freedoms should never be sacrificed in the name of national security. This essay proposes that the protection of individual freedoms by maintaining national security is a fundamental principle and goal of democracy. US President Joe Biden notes, \u201cI strongly believe that democracy is the key to freedom, prosperity, peace, and dignity\u201d (Biden 3). Unlike authoritarian or totalitarian systems, a democratic system puts individual freedoms ahead of national security interests. The implementation of this principle always raises controversy, since there is no single rule universal for all cases. However, individual freedoms are protected in most areas of social life, including migration, cyber security, economic stability, and",
        "The introduced Canadian perspective on the provisional agenda of the North Atlantic Council seems to cover key points that concern Canadian security. Increased presence in the world peace operations and maintenance of tight relationships with other NATO members, especially remarkable is the smart defense approach that considers the military and economic needs of Canada. Although, it is difficult to judge the extent of the Syrian threat to Canadian interest during the outbreak of coronavirus, which seems to continue even today. Therefore, it would be essential to review the proposed question for a more effective approach to the defense of Canadian interests. Nevertheless, this act protects the interest of both Israel and Canada and will positively impact their relationship. Furthermore, it is notable how the Canadian government is willing to cooperate with the withdrawal of troops from Iraq if the official request were to be made. This statement in itself is probably a contribution to the international image of Canadian humanitarianism, but the extent of such image improvement is questionable. The focus on building trading relationships and close ties with other NATO countries could be seen as the most important aspect that Israel might acknowledge. Israel's national security has experienced decades of varying threats, which included terrorism, missiles, and existential nuclear dangers (Freilich, 2018). However, the former national security strategy (NSS) is",

Clearly enough, it is impossible without a thorough understanding of a company's business environment. When it comes to entering the market with the goods for the purchasers' consumption, the one theory that specialists often take to is the supply and demand theory. This theory is utilized to understand the customers' buying behaviors and help managers strategize the product in the market in accordance with them. For instance, a lack of demand for the product signifies that supply needs to be shortened \u2013 and vice versa: when there is an increase of demand, it is reasonable to enhance supply of goods as well. Additionally, a supply and demand analysis helps in pricing: if the demand for the product is high, buyers are more likely to accept price increases an keep on purchasing it. With the low demand, however, prices should be sufficiently affordable; otherwise, the producer will suffer losses. There are various strategies to make the supply and demand model work to one's advantage. Dayton cites an example of De Beers \u2013 a company specializing in creating diamond jewelry. Their vaults",

Using the standard risk evaluation process, it is possible to differentiate the risks into two large groups. These are risks to the continuation and completion of the project and risks to the end product's performance after the project has been completed. The risks to the continuation and completion of the project are as follows: * Unforeseen delays and time expenditures. It is possible that the project's implementation will be more complex than anticipated, requiring more time; * Individuals participating in the project might become sick and slow down production; * The available hardware and software may malfunction. The risks for the performance of the end product are as follows: * The product might not be secure enough to be allowed to work with personal student data; * The product would be economically unfeasible to run; * The product would not perform adequately to the university's requirements. Time-related problems could be identified by comparing the progress made with the timeline developed before starting the project. Functionality and requirements",
        "The concept of \u201cgender roles\u201d is often applied to the analysis and comprehension of writings from various historical periods. These responsibilities appear to have been firmly defined during the Anglo-Saxon period. The poem Beowulf belongs to the epic or heroic poetry genre, which has poems that commemorate the characters' brave and martial actions. Women are portrayed as belongings for the advantage of the men throughout Beowulf and are made to support the male characters. In addition, women are utilized as plot devices to advance the story tale of men. Women, on the other hand, are a minor character in the plot, their presence being overshadowed by the men. The queen of the Swedes was given no name, her identity being secondary to her status as the king's wife, Onela. The males, such as Hrothgar, Beowulf, Wiglaf, and Unferth, occupied the majority of the storyline of the poem. As a result, mentions of women are few and far between in comparison. \u201c\u2026the Helming woman went on her rounds\u2026treating the family and the collected troop,\u201d the poem says of a woman who fulfills traditional gender responsibilities as a character Beowulf (Heaney 620).

        "Everyone has read detective stories at least once in their life or watched detective programs on TV. Sometimes it could be seen that the heroes of the works use so-called indented writings. These writings can be on the second, third, and so on pages, depending on the pressure on the writing subject, that is, a pen or pencil. Even though such records are difficult to see, the examiners still have the experience and specialized equipment to ensure that this concealment was revealed. Indented writing is invisible indentations in the sheets of paper located under the page on which the information was initially written. Indented writing can help solve a case, as it often has the information necessary for the investigation (Girard, 2017). In order to see the inscriptions, one can use a pencil, but for forensic experts, it is an unprofessional tool that can only harm the evidence. Indented entries often do not match the information written on the surface of the original document. To open the information, specialists use various professional equipment. It includes a device for a laboratory that works to restore documents with indents. In addition, a photographic method is used, which is based on sliding light, and an electrostatic detection device is also used (Girard, 2017). Naturally, specialists must have the necessary skills and knowledge to detect information written using indentation. Moreover, the use of a soft pencil or copy paper can",
        "President Franklin Roosevelt did much to end the Great Depression, which included passing acts and laws. They were aimed not only at restoring the economy and infrastructure but also at improving the situation of certain groups of the population. They included immigrants, African Americans, and workers, creating health clinics, special courses, college buildings, new schools, and recreation facilities, thus, increasing their quality of life. The first act I would like to analyze is the creation of the Public Works Administration (PWA). It was a Federal American Agency created during the New Deal by President Franklin Roosevelt (Corbett, 2014). This act not only contributed to recreation from the Great Depression but also provided workers, immigrants, and African Americans with workplaces and necessary social infrastructure. The act was specialized in building and public works, which formulated an improvement in the industrial field as well. The next act I have chosen to consider is Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA). This act focused on the improvement of agricultural fields by providing farmers who decreased their land compensation (Week 6 Lesson, 2022). Thus, the president managed not only to engage people to participate in the agricultural spectrum but also promoted improvement of the African American, immigrants, and workers conditions. It helped farmers as prices for corps raised; thus, the business became more profitable. However, there was another side to the coin as people had to pay",

According to Rosenberg (2019), Mary Mallon was \u201cthe first \u201chealthy carrier\u201d of typhoid fever\u201d recognized in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century, which made her infamous as Typhoid Mary (para. 1). This woman was found to be a typhoid bacteria carrier, and healthcare authorities accused her of 47 illnesses and three deaths, isolating her on an island for most of her life (Rosenberg, 2019, para. 45). Woolliscroft (2020) argues that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and people's public health responsibilities are \u201ca modern instance of a long-standing problem as exemplified by the celebrated case\u201d of Typhoid Mary (p. 1141). The story of the coronavirus outbreak during the 2020 charity tournament of Novak Djokovic is a recent example of a mass disease spread. As Shapiro (2020) reports, four tennis players tested positive for COVID-19 despite the organizers' effort to follow health guidelines and ensure safety (para. 1). In contrast to the Typhoid Mary situation, modern safety protocols and quarantine interventions allowed to limit the adverse consequences of the Djokovic case for the public. Overall, humanity has significantly improved public health measures since the Typhoid Mary incident in the 20th century. While the case of Mary Mallon",

Lerner proceeded from the fact that in the process of modernization, all societies move in the same direction, which was set by the Western countries that had completed modernization earlier. However, this \u201cWestern model,\u201d according to Lerner, is, in fact, global. It acquired its name only due to a historical confluence of circumstances. Countries of the North Atlantic were the first to carry out the processes of secularization, urbanization, and industrialization. Analyzing the modernization of lifestyles based on empirical material, Lerner pays the most attention to the growth of population mobility, the spread of literacy, and the mass media. For example, Lerner dwelled on the problem of restrictions for modernization. Among the most critical factors hindering development, he attributed ethnocentrism. Lerner states, \u201cFrom the West came the stimuli which undermined traditional society in the Middle East; for the reconstruction of a modern society that will operate efficiently\u201d (Lerner 47). The author contrasts societies, at the same time declaring that the focus on cultural identity impedes progress. I believe that this concept of modernization designed to solve the problems of transition from \u201cbackwardness\u201d to \u201cmodernity\u201d was a",
        "Miranda warning, also known as Miranda rights, is a formal statement in which a person being arrested is informed of their basic civil rights under the jurisdiction of the United States. Through this warning, an officer of the law enforcement notifies the individual of their right to remain silent, as well as to an attorney. Such principles reflect the foundation of the legal system of the United States, in which both sides are protected by a comprehensive set of rights in order to eliminate bias and enable an objective investigation of the case. The obligatory nature of the warning serves the interests of both sides of the process. First of all, the person being detained possesses an inherent set of rights, which must be respected within the framework of the court of law. They are guaranteed by the United States Constitution, and depriving a person of them would be a major violation of this fundamental law. Rogers and Drogin (2019) state that it would be a misconception to believe that every resident is fully informed of their rights by default. Furthermore, a failure to provide a notification of rights may render the defendant's testimony inadmissible in court, as it can be dismissed due to possible coercion. This way, Miranda warnings align with the interests of both defendants and prosecutors. On the other hand, it appears possible to argue for the",
        "The editing in the first episode of the series Money Heist is in line with its thrilling plot and rapid action. In the first scene, as the character gets ready to exit her vehicle, the editing is quick, focusing on the items she is picking up. Similarly, the camera often focuses on objects, leading the viewer towards the items that will become an essential part of the narrative. For example, one can see the ringing phone before it is picked up. Moreover, the show uses rapid editing with close-ups and the use of objects that identify characters \u2013 guns, money, and other items that show one's motives or their identifying trait. The characters' close-ups are dynamic, often using dolly shots to slowly expose the background or move with the character. This way, the camera does not stop as long as the characters move or the whole room is exposed. When they stop, the editing is as rapid as the conversation between people. In monologues, the dolly is used again to keep the tension as the series requires a serious tone in many scenes dealing with life-or-death scenarios. Notably, the character in a close-up",
        "The concept of nursing is closely associated with the idea of continuous improvement, as the trends of health care need to mirror the existing social trends to provide the best care possible. One way to secure such care is to refer to the latest scholarly findings to modify the approaches to care provision in the workplace. This process of implementing research-based findings in daily patient care is known as evidence-based practice (EBP) (Wilson & Austria, 2021). Currently, EBP is not used actively by nurses for several reasons. First, the workload of most nurses discourages their desire to learn and embrace EBP. According to McArthur et al. (2021), a physical opportunity is a construct that contributes to the nurses' ability to resort to EBM. Physical opportunity includes such barriers as \u201ccost and lack of resources, compromised communication, staff turnover, and limited physical guidelines\u201d (McArthur et al., 2021, p. 20). As a result, management promotes behavioral patterns that react to the environment rather than examine it in advance. The second massive barrier to EBP in the workplace is the lack of social opportunity embodied in the lack of organizational support and teamwork (McArthur et al., 2021). Since the aforementioned examples tackle only a minor part of the existing challenged, the need to intervene and facilitate EBP is evident. The first commonly mentioned approach to facilitate",

Anyone may be affected by anorexia, and about 1-2% of the population suffers from the disorder (Cleveland Clinic Medical Staff, 2021). Key symptoms include: Emotional and mental signs: fear of gaining weight, obsession with counting calories or diets, irritability, self-criticism, and other characteristics. Behavioral signs: changes in eating habits, excessive exercise, and other features. Physical signs: weight loss, fatigue, weakness, and similar symptoms. Pay attention: Anorexia is possible even if there are no underweight signs, and one needs to pay attention to other symptoms. Genetics and family history: brain chemistry impacts appetite, mood, and self-control; therefore, people who have relatives suffering from eating disorders are at a higher risk. Trauma or life changes: through food control, a person copes with a traumatic event or significant life changes. Culture and environment: imposed media unrealistic ideals of beauty. Peer influence: bullying or ridicule due to the appearance of a teenager.

        "Global climate change, as has now been proven by the latest research, is caused by human activity. Awareness of the seriousness of the situation is gradually penetrating into world public opinion. There is still an opportunity to mitigate the consequences to avoid the worst. People can all unite in order to change the situation, even though this process may be gradual and take some time. The main difficulty is connected with the extremely uneven distribution of greenhouse gas emissions between developed and developing countries, large and small. However, it is possible to change the situation by taking small steps. For instance, the population should use public transportation instead of cars. When using cars, there is an enormous amount of exhaustive fumes released in the atmosphere. This initiative can contribute to lower gas emissions, further reducing the consequences of global warming. Additionally, people can start saving energy by drying laundry on a rope, not in an electric dryer. One may also set a lower switch-on temperature on the heating system thermostat (What Are the Solutions). What is more, meat production entails significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions than chicken production, growing vegetables, fruits and cereals. Therefore, people should start eating more of those to live healthier and more aware. In conclusion, global warming is a severe threat to modern society and is likely to affect",
        "Perspective is an important consideration in art, one that determines the way people look at a painting and what they see, how they see it, and how they interact with it. Additionally, it is responsible for the way people understand an image in its cultural context or intended meaning. While exploring the google arts and culture exhibit, I have been able to see a number of different religious paintings that use perspective in interesting ways. I think that the discussion of perspective is important for those both close and far from the art world, as it promotes engagement with paintings that can often be overlooked. To narrow down my search, I have looked up \u201cReligious painting\u201d, and went with the results that seemed most interesting to discuss. First, I want to take a look at The Adoration of the Magi, painted by Sandro Botticelli. The image depicts people adoring a number of \u201cwise men\u201d who were considered to be especially important in Florence, where it was painted (The adoration of the magi \u2013 sandro botticelli \u2013 google arts & culture). The linear perspective allows the audience to see everything that is happening from a detached angle, taking in the scenery and understanding the importance of the event to the people depicted. While the magi are being revered by the people of Florence, the audience also understands that they are close to their followers, therefore placing them in close perspective proximity to each other.

        "Gendered behavior denotes fundamental expressions of gender socialization and identity through an individual's various developmental phases. Thus, gendered behaviors refer to the ways persons behave according to their respective male or female genders (Au & Rudolfsdottir, 2021). One of the prominent gendered behaviors instilled in me during childhood was that women are the primary cooks in the home. Hence, from childhood, I learned how to prepare food for the family, unlike most male relatives around. Even the movies mostly depicted women as the cooks in the home. Perhaps the gendered role that I quickly adopted/ accepted from childhood was the idea that women are natural caregivers. The function depicted women as noble people who consider the plight of others in the home and society and consistently seek to alleviate suffering. Women are warm, nurturing, and caring. Thus, many regarded professions that require empathy like nursing and teaching to the women's domain. The idea that women are more humane and caring appealed to me and caused me to accept the role. In my mind, the part admitted what many would prefer to ignore/ deny: women play critical roles in retaining sanity in the world. For me, the role meant that women could play vital functions in stemming the tide of oppression, suffering, and",
        "Woman with a Parasol \u2013 Madame Monet and Her Son is a painting by the French artist Claude Monet, a founder and one of the most outstanding representatives of impressionism. Painted in 1875, this canvas became one of Monet's most well-known and influential works (Brodska\u00efa and Kalitina). The two figures in the painting are Monet's wife Camille and his son Jean. The lower third of the painting shows a grassy area, and the other two-thirds contain the figures of a woman and a little boy behind her. Monet's wife and child are the focal points of the composition. The lower viewpoint allows seeing the blue sky with white clouds behind the figures, which creates a unique lightning effect (Daily Dose of Art). Placed in the distance from the woman, the boy's figure also gives depth to the painting; this compositional technique guides the eye of the observer diagonally downward, which was common for several other works by Monet. The use of colors and light in this painting is truly impressive. The sun is shining on the figures from the background, casting a shadow. The strokes of colors are warm, bright, and vibrant, mixed together with the muted grays of the woman's dress. It reflects a whole range of colors around her: the blues of the sky, the yellow of the flowers, and light, complementary strokes of purple (Joy of Museums Virtual Tours).",
        "In the development of nursing in Europe in the 19th century, the activities of an outstanding personality, the Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, played an important role. Florence was looking for an opportunity to help the poor and the sick. At that distant time, activities related to mercy, helping those in need, were considered an occupation not worthy of a noblewoman. The young woman sacrificed personal life expensive relationships with her parents but remained faithful to her calling. Furthermore, her values and commitment allowed Florence to become a historical figure in modern nursing, to whose leadership people owe accolades for paving the way of nursing's place in our societies. Thanks to perseverance and perseverance, in 1851, Florence entered the community of the sisters of pastor F. Flender in Germany, where she received a nursing education. Subsequently, Florence made a considerable contribution not only to the treatment of cholera help in wars but to the development of leadership and the reformation of nursing (Kim, 2020) The selfless woman became an example of service to people and a prototype of international mercy. Moreover, Florence managed to change a common thought about nobility of nursing, her leadership allowed to reestablish pivotal understanding of nursing practice.

        "In order to understand the structure and functions of society, it is essential to study a vast number of sociological theories and perspectives created by various scientists. For example, Emile Durkheim, a French sociologist, expressed his view of society in the theory of functionalism. According to Durkheim, there is vital interconnectivity of all the elements of any society that share common ideas and principles, and the sum of these elements is not as great as the society itself. The sociologist viewed society as a huge biological organism that requires all its parts to function properly in order to remain alive. Further, when discussing collective and individual behavior, Durkheim stated that these two concepts are entirely different, and there is the collective conscience that makes people adapt their actions and act in predictable ways. The concept of collective conscience is beneficial and positive as it defines and evaluates the norms of behavior. Nevertheless, not all sociologists share the same view on society. For example, there is also a conflict theory developed by Karl Marx. Unlike functionalism, conflict theory views society as a system with an ongoing class conflict, primarily between the proletariats and the bourgeoisie. The main cause of this conflict is the lack of resources and their unequal distribution, while its effects are connected with the necessary changes happening in",
        "The case under consideration, Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S., was significant for developing measures to avoid discrimination in the workplace. More specifically, it was primarily related to diversity in terms of sex and age since this combination frequently evokes the concerns of the population (King, 2021). The examination of the issue by relying on the example of Gerald Bostock was advantageous for establishing proper employment practices in this respect. In this lawsuit filed by the plaintiff, the main factor was his unjustified dismissal from the company in which he had otherwise positive reputation. This event was caused by the man's interest in a gay softball league which he expressed while being in the workplace while neglecting the provisions of Title VII (Mallory et al., 2020). This part of the Civil Rights Act, confirming the violation, was relied on by Bostock when initiating legal action, but it was initially dismissed by the district court due to its allegedly erroneous interpretation (\u201cBostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S.,\u201d 2019). The appeal, including the claim to include sexual discrimination in consideration, was successful as Bostock managed to support his position with the opposing statements of Massachusetts law, Chapter 151B (\u201cBostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S.,\u201d 2019). In this way, the meaning of the previously used provisions regulating such cases was modified accordingly. To summarize, the examined court case based on employment law and, more specifically, discrimination against workers happened to be crucial for making adjustments.

Hence, this gap was compensated for by this decision, and the consequent change in the legal provisions helped guarantee the equality of",
        "The work of a clinical or medical office worker is characterized by a combination of a large number of administrative operations with medical activities. Primarily, these professionals are office assistants filling out paperwork and interacting with staff (\u201cHow to become a medical office assistant,\u201d 2021). As a result, I will be approaching interviews for this job in a professional business style. While the fitting suit can be expensive, I already have the proper formal attire. Using my black formal suit, shoes, and minimal accessories, I can make the right impression without reducing my budget. In warm weather, I can go to an interview right in a suit, and in cold weather, I can add my usual outerwear, for example, an overcoat. Work clothes, theoretically, may require additional investments and purchases. All healthcare workers, including office workers, must wear a special uniform called scrubs, consisting of a short-sleeved shirt and trousers. This uniform is relatively cheap, and a single set of scrubs can be found on Amazon for about $20-$40 (\u201cMedical assistant's uniform,\u201d 2019). Most of all, in this context, one needs to take care of shoes since these specialists sometimes have to stand or walk a lot. A good pair of closed-toe shoes can",
        "With the widespread use of digital technology, email has gained particular importance. With email, communication has become much easier, as people have been able to communicate with colleagues, relatives, loved ones, and business partners and representatives of organizations, literally in real-time, avoiding all the difficulties of \u201cphysical\u201d communication. However, what is interesting is a study of the extent to which such communication has been modified with the advent of the phenomenon of email. In the context of interpersonal communication, two effects should be highlighted. First, email has meaningfully broadened the scope of communication so that communication is no longer only realized in the real world but can easily be continued online as well. This has changed the perception of interpersonal communication and greatly simplified the availability of communication. Meanwhile, email has changed the perception of nonverbal communication through emotions and body language, since in text correspondence, especially of a business nature, such expressions of speech do not make sense (Smith, n.d.). Of course, there are alternatives in the form of emoji and stickers, but in emails, as a rule, such forms are rarely used, unlike in messengers. From these features, an essential advantage of email is highlighted, namely increased accessibility, the possibility of virtually limitless communication, and staying connected with people at all times. However, there are also disadvantages: dependence on Internet equipment, the need for an",
        "The concepts of domestic violence and abuse refer to psychologically or physically aggressive behavior of one family member towards another. This aggression could take the form of beating, rape, screaming, and humiliation. Unfortunately, in the modern world, these are common phenomena. According to statics provided by Huecker et al. (2021), 10 million Americans per year suffer from violence and abuse. The victims of domestic violence and abuse feel depressed and helpless, and their self-esteem is also extremely low. Fear of the aggressor might force a victim to keep calm about the experience of being abused. Nonetheless, there are signs via which a provider could suspect domestic violence, child abuse, or elder abuse. If a woman arrives at the emergency room with bruises or fractures that do not as she slipped on the wet floor, a nurse could suspect that her partner beats her. In addition to that, victims are highly likely to be depressed and anxious even though they might try to hide these emotions (Lloyd, 2018). A provider has a reason to be concerned with child abuse if a young patient is underweighted without objective reason and is afraid of other adults. In addition to that, a child might get",
        "Being a knowledgeable and experienced professional in one's professional sphere is, without a doubt, of great importance. For this reason, many students of medical education facilities seek to acquire as much theoretical and practical expertise as possible before graduation. Although such a strategy is by no means wrong, I have recently discovered that the true success in the work of healthcare providers is explained by the doctor's ability to build relationships with one's patients. I fully understood the advantage of this simple but often overlooked truth when observing Dr. Wang's work. Dr. Wang is an experienced professional working in the sphere of eye surgery. Yet, it was surprising for me to discover how easily he/she is able to build close relationships with the patients. After analyzing her/his behavior, I realized that there are certain skills that allow Dr. Wang to gain the trust of the people that come to the Eye Surgery Institute. First of all, he/she is an active listener meaning that all of Dr. Wang's patients are encouraged to fully and openly express their symptoms and feelings without being interrupted. Secondly, Dr. Wang is always polite and patient with people regardless of her/his overall mood. Finally, I noticed that Dr. Wang is friendly with regular patients as she/he is interested in their health and everyday lives. For instance, I heard Dr. Wang asking a",
        "Various cultures around the world have unique creation myths and traditional methods of presenting them through art. The cosmology of the Aztec civilization was quite different from the Europeans that conquered them. Firstly, the Europeans' Christian God \u201ccreated mankind in his own image\u201d and granted him dominion over a perfectly constructed world, the Garden of Eden (Holy Bible, New International Version, Genesis 1:27). In the Bible, he is described as a benevolent, if strict, father figure who can forgive humankind their sins and grant them eternal redemption. Consequently, God is depicted in art as a wise, older man with a beard and white hair. Christian art primarily praises the power of His forgiveness and the bountiful nature that He created. In contrast, Aztec creation stories are based on dismembered gods, and thus the origin of the world is catastrophic violence, which explains why Aztec art depicts divinity as gruesome and awe-inspiring (National University, 2022). Their art functions as a warning and an order to obey. They demand blood in exchange for food, and each sculpture of the gods in Aztec culture contains a receptacle for human hearts (National University, 2022). Unlike Christianity, the central figure is a female goddess, but similarly to Eve, she is primarily a passive player whom the other gods punish. Furthermore, Coatlique's choice to give birth a second time against her children's wishes could also be interpreted as the Aztec version of Eve's",
        "It isn't easy to single out the central directions and build a particular hierarchy in the modern art world, including music. Some of the performers influence the minds of young people, and political strategists can use some compositions during elections. The current state of the art is too vague to make clear statements on this subject. Hip-hop performers expose many of the problems of megacities and young people: drugs, cruelty, violence, and lack of life guidelines (Rabinowitch, 2020). The social movement for women's rights is significant for the modern generation, and female performers are becoming iconic people in music. One such person is Lady Gaga, who began her career as a freak with a sensual mezzo-soprano. Performers like her describe the issues of discrimination and harassment emotionally. Some critics single out Moby as an iconic artist who influenced the formation of modern cultural reality. He brought a unique genre and popularized it by making his songs available to the public, including for the political life of the United States. There is a problem with expressing yourself through flashy statements within the framework of modern culture (cancellation culture, hate speech, shaming). In this context, of",
        "The primary source for this study is the general medical journal The Lancet. It publishes the survey data and provides statistics and a comparative analysis of the obtained quantitative information. The Economist can be seen as a secondary source that describes research with less digital content. The study represents a decrease in the HIV infection rate of girls in school by stabilizing their families' financial difficulties. The World Bank funded the study to demonstrate the value of money in reducing the spread of HIV among young, poor girls. The study was authored by Berk \u00d6zler, Lead Economist and Poverty Research Manager. The medical journal The Lancet presented statistics based on a survey in the Zomba district of Malawi (G.C. 2). The Economist later summarized the study with the most critical findings from the analysis. Thus, 1,300 unmarried girls aged 13 to 22 took part in the study. This is a sufficient number of subjects to consider the prevalence of HIV in poor areas. The sampling took place with the help of a computer, so the girls fell into different experimental groups randomly. Thus, a group stood out in which girls and their families were given small amounts of money every month, girls paid to attend school, and girls left without financial support. Based on the study, it can be concluded that the subjects who received the money in both groups",
        "There are numerous US criminal cases that raise the question of trying juvenile offenders in adult courts. Currently, almost in half of the states in the country, juveniles can be prosecuted and tried in adult courts. Pennsylvania is one such state, as there is no lower limit for the age someone can be charged as an adult with homicide. The 2009 case involving a double murder illustrates the numerous issues that take place in all similar cases. In February 2009, state police found 26-year-old Kenzie Houk, who was eight months pregnant, in her bed with a bullet through her head. Jordan Brown, the son of the victim's fianc\u00e9, is one of the youngest suspects in the country to be charged with murder. According to Heide (2021), juvenile murder arrests in the United States increased dramatically from 1984 to 1993, leading experts to forecast an epidemic of continued violence. Since then, numerous approaches and techniques have been tested to reduce juvenile violence. Nevertheless, they have not provided a highly efficient uniform framework that can assist in mitigating the issue. A wide range of factors should be taken into account when realizing the reasons for such a severe problem in the country. Moreover, a dedicated analysis is needed to realize the effectiveness of the already existing programs and institutions aimed at reducing the risks of violent crime among juveniles. Furthermore, the issue of recidivism should be widely discussed, as preventing it has always been considered one of the primary goals of the institutions that work with juvenile criminals. A large",
        "Thich Quang Duc committed self-immolation on the streets of Saigon on June 11, 1963, and it changed the course of history. Today, the photograph of Thich Quang Duc's death, The Burning Monk, has become a universal symbol of rebellion and the fight against injustice. His death was reduced to a symbol, but it was much more than that (Sinzelle, 22). It was an act of defiance against a corrupt government that had killed its citizens. It sparked a revolution, overthrew the regime, and may even have caused the Americans to enter the Vietnam War. However, the monk himself most likely did not die for revolutionary ideas. His self-immolation was an act of rejection of the system and the inability to deal with injustice. Tunisian street vendor Mohammed Bouazizi set himself on fire in protest against harassment by local officials. The desperate act of the young man caused mass street protests in the city. The rioters demanded the resignation of President Ben Ali. His political regime faced long-term economic and social problems, resulting in unemployment, mostly among young people. Mohammed Bouazizi became a symbol of the Arab Spring; he gained followers in Tunisia and other Arab countries, which also led to mass protests. Most of the self-immolations did not impact the current situation; however, some of them played an important role in",
        "In the grand scheme of things, prosecutors and victims of violent crimes are natural allies. The prosecutors strive to bring the offenders to justice, whether to fulfill their duty before the law or achieve career progress. At the same time, the victims get moral satisfaction when the criminals are brought to justice. Therefore, one might think that prosecutors and victims are naturally supposed to cooperate. However, this logical scenario does not necessarily happen in practice. Sometimes, the victims cannot adequately cooperate with the prosecutors due to the experienced shock, fear, or mistreatment in the prosecutor's office. During the mid-70s, the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration funded the first Victim/Witness Assistance Projects (VWAPs) in order to enhance cooperation between the prosecutors' offices and victims (Karmen, 2019). With time, the VWAPs have become firmly established institutions charged with the noble mission of supporting crime victims. Prosecutor offices can assist the victims of violent crimes through various means. The best practices include psychological help in hotlines and crisis counseling, shelter, food, transportation, and property recovery (Karmen, 2019). In addition, most VWAPs make referrals to local agencies, which provide the victims with long-term care (Karmen, 2019). Furthermore, prosecutor offices offer legal assistance through pamphlets about the adjudication process. Finally, VWAPs mitigate confusion by notifying the victims about indictments, postponements, acquittals, convictions, and other possible developments in the case (Karmen, 2019).",

One of the cultural artifacts that denote the life of women in Ancient Egypt is the sculpture under the title Nefertiti Bust. It is a life-sized 47-cm high bust of the queen of Egypt, Nefertiti, who was pharaoh's wife and lived in the 13 th century BC (\u201cThe bust,\u201d 2022). The artifact is currently displayed at the Egyptian Museum of Berlin. Due to the high social and political status of the queen, this cultural artifact might have served as a commemorative or burial attribute. Commonly, bust sculptures in Ancient Egypt were \u201cassigned to the realm of private ancestor worship in the domestic sphere or in the context of burials\u201d (\u201cThe bust,\u201d para. 21). However, it indicates the high status that a woman could obtain in ancient Western civilizations, where she could perform as the head of a state. The sculpture has a significant cultural and historical value due to its indication of the appraisal of the figure of Nefertiti by society. Moreover, in the context of history, this artifact is invaluable because it was preserved in a very good condition, allowing for examining the materials ad techniques used meticulously to create this",
        "In 2020, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-05, which deferred the effective dates of Topic 606 and Topic 842 by one year. This update gave private companies a much-needed relief, which was overwhelmed by numerous challenges associated with fighting off the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though many companies had adopted the new revenue recognition policy, both preparers and auditors experienced significant difficulties applying the new accounting standards in practice. The central problem was that the new standard, unlike GAAP, does not provide sufficient detail on the implementation rules. Instead, it gives a theoretical basis similar to all industries, which leaves the details open for interpretation. There are several issues associated with revenue recognition that private companies face in all industries. First, Topic 606 requires revenues to be recorded when or as the company satisfied a performance obligation, which does not allow the companies to recognize costs right away. Second, there was a significant problem with variable consideration, as contractors needed to identify the most likely outcome and adjust the value of a contract. Before Topic 606 was implemented, it was impossible to recognize revenues based on a claim. Finally, the number of required disclosures increased significantly. Even though the majority of firms are",

Sia wrote the song for Rihanna, who holds the song's copyrights and worked on it a year prior; therefore, the song is owned by an independent contractor (Anggraini 12). Unapologetic is Barbadian artist Rihanna's seventh studio album, and the song \u201cDiamonds\u201d appears on it (Anggraini 7). Using Sia's demo vocals as a guide, Rihanna imitated her inflections to the precise tiniest detail.

        "The video \u201cPlay is more than just fun\u201d features a bio-psycho-social-spiritual issue of play and its importance in people's life. The concept of play is regarded as a developmental issue, connecting a person's body to his brain through some links. The play is considered a significant part of people's lives since it allows individuals to hone their skills, manual and mental (Brown, 2008). Moreover, through play, a person's values may be developed. Group play allows developing such qualities as loyalty to one's group, codependence, and the spirit of competition. The game fosters connections within the brain at a subconscious level and helps people relax and be themselves. The issue of importance in my life is whether one can improve one's memory through a game. Nowadays, when I am a student, I have to memorize a lot of information, and I have found that traditional methods of purposeful memorizing are not always effective. I believe that since games act subconsciously, there is a good chance to improve one's memory if one can find the right kind of games. Moreover, playing games helps to relax; and relaxing while memorizing something useful could be a very good and beneficial activity. I would like to explore further how play fosters innovation and what",
        "The work Promises and challenges of Blockchain in education by Jae Park examines the blockchain concept, which has the potential to become a leading socio-economic technology in the context of network neutrality and big data. This study suggests that current trends in the Internet space will set new standards for digital ownership and storage. A comprehensive study of industrial and financial blockchain will greatly contribute to crypto education, crypto administration, human resources management, financial procurement, and other related fields. The principal purpose of the study is to observe the proposed tasks set by blockchain technology and the challenges expected in this direction. Blockchain was originally developed to operate with digital documents in 1991. In 2009, the technology started to be used in terms of cryptocurrency and has been proving its effectiveness for a long time (Park, 2021). The leading purpose of blockchain technology is to sidestep the violation of identity and information transmission. Avoiding any suspense is conducted with the help of blockchain. The technology preserves all data regarding the virtual identity and transactions, which is transparent to all parties involved but severely secured by well-built cryptography. The paper also explains the successful usage of blockchain in any aspect of intellectual property, copyright, and licensing. It describes the advantages and mechanisms of blockchain application in industrial sectors and education",
        "The story of the extreme rise and the following fall of the Enron Corporation still interests many people. Not everyone is aware of all the circumstances and factors that affected the company's struggle, and only some people know how many resources, including places and people, were involved in the corporation. The record-breaking bankruptcy of \u201cthe seventh largest company in the United States and the sixth largest energy company in the world\u201d was surprising for the society (The Nigerian Professional Accountant, n.d., para. 2). This company was founded in 1985, and its first year in the market was already characterized by a huge loss and an enormous amount of debt. However, thanks to the changes in American governmental policy related to the natural gas industry operations, Enron managed to rise. Now, it is necessary to analyze this case and evaluate the fatal mistakes that the corporation made. There is an extended number of different theories and assumptions about the reasons that Enron struggled and then filed for bankruptcy. First, the projects that the corporation invested in turned out to be too risky and failed, which resulted in the inability of Enron to pay its debts (The Nigerian Professional Accountant, n.d.). Other issues like abuse of accounting and utilization of SPEs to hide the corporation debt added to",
        "Ageism is a global problem of discriminating and stereotyping people based on their age. It contributes to prejudice in society, causing a psychological impact on individuals and creating biased attitudes toward certain populations (Ayalon & Tesch-R\u00f6mer, 2018). Media is often responsible for stereotyping different age groups, in particular, older adults. This paper aims to discuss two examples of ageism and one example of a positive characterization of the elderly in the media. Cliches and stereotypes about older adults in advertising cause negative attitudes in people as they present unrealistic and out-of-touch messages to the audience. For example, \u201cThis Is Getting Old\u201d is an advertisement by E-Trade that depicts older adults working jobs they hate and cannot perform because they have not managed to save enough for retirement (Advertising TV, 2018). This stereotypical video is ageist because it supports bias and discrimination against older workers, people struggling financially, and the elderly in general. Another example of ageism is an advertisement, \u201cDear Young People, Don't Vote,\u201d where older adults urge the youth not to vote (NAIL Communications, 2018). This video is ageist because it portrays the elderly as a selfish, indifferent, and uncaring category, which is inaccurate and discriminative. A positive example includes an advertisement by DocMorris, where an older man persistently exercises to lift his granddaughter",
        "Gender Stereotypes and Discrimination Nowadays, gender stereotypes and sexual discrimination make people confront various issues which may lead to negative consequences. For instance, Sandberg (2010) discusses why men reach top positions in the workforce much more often than women. During her lecture, Sandberg addresses this problem by providing current statistics on the male and female employment gap, suggesting that it is highly more challenging for women to choose between personal life and career success. Overall, the Ted Talk is highly insightful, offering the viewers a chance to reflect on modern gender inequality difficulties. In this Ted Talk, Sandberg also raises a question regarding the changes that are needed to alter the current disbalance in the number of men and women that achieve professional excellence. From my perspective, this is a vital issue, and I would like to explore the possibilities for addressing it. One of the most critical reasons for inequality is related to gender differences established in society. Brown et al. (2022) discuss so-called gender roles, which are \u201cdifferences in how men and women are supposed to act\u201d (para. 9). Such a phenomenon should not exist in the first place because men and women might presume that there is a particular script they should follow",
        "The clothing industry is amongst the many monopolistically competitive industries. There are many clothing firms in the industry competing against each other while producing similar products. However, the firms in the industry earn competitive advantages by distinguishing their products through branding and advertisements (Davis and \u00d6zg\u00fcr, 4). Product differentiation is one of the strategies commonly used by monopolistic competitive firms. Product differentiation in a clothing firm can involve designs, the quality of materials used, and the prices charged for the clothes. In advertisements, differentiation is put in physical aspects such as color, designs, elastic, and different sizes (Davis and \u00d6zg\u00fcr, 7). Intangible aspects included in the clothing advertisement can be guaranteed money back, high quality, free delivery, and long-lasting usage. Steel manufacturing is an example of an oligopolistic competitive industry. In such a market, a few steel manufacturing companies rule over other firms. The few firms are the price and trendsetters for other small companies and often form a partnership to operate successfully (Ritz 185). To distinguish themselves from their competitors, they improve their product quality, hike or lower prices, and advertise the special features of their products. In an oligopolistic market, if a leading company lowers prices, the others do not follow but rather improve their products to remain in the higher cuts of prices (Ritz 187). The few leading companies",
        "Subsidizing programs are considered welfare and net initiatives that the government takes to aid low-income families and individuals affected by poverty. These programs offset the essential needs of the citizens from health, food, housing, and education. Such an initiative aims to allow people access to quality services and save some money for their personal growth. The subject of whether the subsidizing of essentials causes an incentive or de-incentive to seek employment is a debatable one. An example of a subsidized program is the subsidized housing, House Vouchers, and Public Housing programs. This scheme was initiated specifically for the poor and the disabled. Through the plan, citizens from economically low backgrounds and those physically impaired could afford to live in private and government-owned rental houses. Generally, it can be argued that the programs have a great potential of incentivizing recipients to seek employment. For instance, most job opportunities are found in urban centers. Having an initiative that makes life affordable in the towns and provides cheap residential houses encourages people to seek jobs in the cities. The fact that people can save some money from their salary motivates most people as it allows them to grow economically. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, I perceive subsidized programs as essential for individual growth and the country's economic growth. The pandemic, for instance, caused significant disruptions to international",
        "The rock and music pop scene were introduced to and gained popularity on television through massive hit shows for teenagers. The three primary ones were Where the Action Is on CBS, Shinding on ABC, and Hullabaloo on NBC. As more households had access to televisions along with the growth of widespread range of programming, including musical ones, the television played a significant role in distributing the music to the public. The bands that appeared on these hit TV shows went on to see significant success in the charts. The television shows helped to articulate the new sort of youth music culture and almost became a star-making mechanism in a relationship and profits that the music and television industries shared. Some bands, such as the Monkees, the American response to the Beatles, were created with the purpose of television performance as their acting and on-camera comfort as a group were initially prioritized over music. However, the Monkees' music took off astronomically beyond anyone's expectations. Nevertheless, they were a band groomed by the entertainment industry with an emphasis on television performances which took away much of the authenticity, even when compared to their counterparts The Beatles, who although made visual content, focused on their own music strongly (Covach and Flory 212). Television drastically went on to change the landscape of the music industry. First, a split formed among artists",
        "An aboriginal person is an individual characterized as a descendant of indigenous inhabitants of Australia. Before the arrival of Europeans, the indigenous people of Australia occupied most of the land, which they protected and fertilized to support cultivation. The aboriginal people mainly practiced hunting and gathering as their source of livelihood before adopting agricultural practices. The aboriginal people arrived in Australia from Asia via Southeast Asia and have inhabited the land between 45000 and 50000 years ago. After the arrival of European colonialists, the indigenous people faced many challenges such as economic, political, and disruption of their tradition. The aboriginal people lost their culture, land, and family without considering the extermination of European imperialism policies; they became enslaved by the Europeans. During the colonial period, the indigenous people faced a high rate of discrimination, resulting in displacement since the colonial powers occupied a large part of the fertile lands, resulting in many deaths of indigenous communities. For instance, over 200 languages the aboriginal people spoke lost value since the European colonialist did not recognize their culture. Many families were forced out of their land, thus dispersing to other parts of Australia. The descendant of the aboriginal people should be recognized as one person since they share the bloodline, customs, and beliefs with",
        "The Alabama State constitution strives to provide and protect a wide array of citizens' rights. Most notably, some of these rights are replicated in the American Bill of Rights. Like the American Bill of Rights, the Alabama State constitution is equally detailed and has different sections that are dedicated to enhancing and protecting citizens' liberties. The standout element within the Alabama State constitution regarding the protection of rights is the freedom of speech. Within the Bill of Rights, The First Amendment guards the citizens' freedom of speech as it enables them to not only express themselves through speech but also via protest groups (Weinberger, 2019). The Alabama State constitution echoes similar sentiment as Section 4 prevents the development of any laws that would curtail the citizens' freedom of speech. To this end, the Alabama State constitution supports the Bill of Rights and emphasizes protecting the freedom of speech for the citizenry. Both the Fourteenth Amendment and Equal Rights Amendment deal with a similar concept of discrimination. On the one hand, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted to prevent former slaves from discrimination. Subsequently, black persons who had been formerly enslaved were conferred equal before the law (Young, 2018). On the other hand, the Equal Rights Amendment is an extrapolation of the Fourteenth Amendment as it guarantees equal treatment of all American citizens irrespective of their gender. At the",
        "The American War of Independence is between the American colonies and Great Britain. The revolution's success eventually depended on the willingness of Americans to risk their lives and economic well-being in the name of patriotism. The revolution was a conservative attempt to preserve freedoms that seemed to be threatened by British politics. However, the war was accompanied by social and intellectual transformations that radically changed the nature of American politics and brought ordinary people into politics to an unprecedented degree. It was the main reason why the Patriots were willing to risk their lives for the sake of independence and change. Firstly, the Patriots wanted the American colonies to gain independence from Great Britain as they wanted their own independent country. People in America felt they were being treated unfairly by the British (DiPucchio, 2020). They were taxed without voting or being represented by the British government. Soon, the first battles for freedom were heard throughout the colonies. The Patriots wanted freedom from British rule and fought for it. Secondly, the American fighters for independence were more willing to sacrifice their lives because they wanted to defend universal ideals. Indeed, American intellectuals were greatly influenced by the ideas of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who promoted the natural rights and freedoms of every man (The Library of Congress, n.d.). However, with its rigid class system and the unrestrained power of the monarchy, the",
        "Software piracy passes as any act resulting in stealing legally protected software. The act's impact on the individual and society increases productivity risks through security holes that cause users to experience glitches and bugs. The outcome of the experience is frustrations, lost times, and lost work (Parson, n.d.). Two, the absence of warranties with the pirated software means they are exposed to increased security risks with the software containing viruses and associated malware that affect computers (Parson, n.d.). Third, the individual or society is exposed to legal risks associated with pirated software when caught using it. Piracy results in economic risks that take away legitimate software sales to the software company. Law-abiding companies are forced to illegally share their work with others (Parson, n.d.). Further, with other companies outside the software industry willing to pirate and save money, software companies run losses amounting to billions of dollars annually. In the U.S., consumers searching for illegal content have a choice of proliferated platforms enabling them to stream pirated material.

        "The difference between a doctor approaching a patient in comparison with nursing practice on the same subject can be an excellent topic due to the highlighted features that are emphasized when parallel. Thus, medical practice using one's physiological status while nursing also implementing psychological responses is an effective way in making the difference between the two clear while operating based on PICOT. The points to be included are the difference in the research approach. Since medical practice is more objective due to the fact that it relies on specific outcomes and facts, the research is quantitative. On the other hand, the PICOT question included in the nursing practice implies mixed research that considers both opinions and data. Topic presents the differentiation between nursing and medical practice in terms of approach to diagnosis. The vital factor that is being brought up is the PICOT in relation to lab results versus assessment based on symptoms. The research can highlight the outcomes in terms of the accuracy of the findings while focusing on the comparison between the two concepts. The aspect that illustrates its importance is the overall parallel between the two models that may have similar results depending on how the research will be conducted and its findings. The potential research focusing on the nursing practice of preventing certain injuries",
        "In general, numerous types of reasoning exist and find implementation, but not all of them bear special significance for decisions affecting patient care. Approaches to reasoning can be classified into types based on the inductive or deductive direction of inquiry, the use of analogy or abduction, the utilization of decomposition and evidence synthesis, and so on. In the healthcare field, reliance on credible evidence is what informs the professional community's approach to clinical reasoning, given that mere suggestions and excessive experimentation and creativity involve extra risks for healthcare consumers. Particularly, the so-called frequency-based reasoning dominates the field, especially when it comes to guideline development, and it requires practitioners to rely on statistics in making clinical decisions (Wieringa et al., 2018). This way of thinking has diverse benefits, including the ability to limit reliance on questionable hypotheses and make virtually any decision integrated with the global healthcare knowledge base. To clarify the standards for reasoning and determine their levels, relevant evaluative questions must be posed. When formulating such questions, it might be essential to distinguish between the scientific and ethical levels of clinical reasoning. From the viewpoint of the scientific perspective, asking questions about the thinking process's clarity, alignment with the previously reported evidence, and relevance to objective information pertaining to the client is important to further detail the standards of reasoning.",
        "The modern world economy is so diverse and deep that it is very difficult to predict for sure when a crisis will break. Recession is danger, and danger is stress \u2013 in such a situation, the brain begins to rely on basic instincts of protection \u2013 to run, hide, survive. Crisis intervention is a relatively new discipline, the main task of which is to provide temporary emergency emotional assistance to victims of mental and physical violence (Colford & Cavaiola, 2017). Nowadays, there is a risk of economic decline which can seriously affect the entire population; hence, I would not like to experience recession since it would significantly affect my life. The crisis is a phenomenon that takes a toll primarily on the individuals who work for non-profit organizations. There is an increase in layoffs, which means many people will have live on the state allowance. The inability to find a job is the next cause of the crisis. What is more, the level of poverty will raise making people abandon their homes. Individuals will not be able to afford necessary items as well as paying rent. Hence, I consider a recession as an undesirable event for myself due to its damaging nature. When considering the crisis from a professional point of view, the crisis affects the national economy as a whole, affecting not individual enterprises, but the entire sector of the economy. There is an increase in the cost",
        "One of the most critical factors of breast cancer development is heredity since it causes a genetically inherent disease. If the patient's closest relatives have been diagnosed with breast cancer, a tumor's likelihood is high even at a young age (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2016). Since one of the patient's close relatives had this disease, this diagnosis is indeed possible for her as well. Another significant factor in developing cancer is various diseases of the mammary glands, for example, \u201ccystic\u201d breasts. In the presence of such conditions, the formation of atypical cells is possible in the mammary gland (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). This can lead to their overgrowth and increase the risk of more severe diseases. The hormonal factor also has a critical influence on health. In the described case, this aspect is the most significant since it includes various details of the patient's life. These include the first pregnancy after 30 years, not breastfeeding, and many years of taking hormonal contraceptives. This leads to the fact that the patient's hormonal background can be disrupted (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). Therefore, with age, it becomes more difficult for the body to deal with abnormal processes. If there is an initial stage of cancer, there can be no metastasis in the patient's",
        "Students, parents, and teachers remain overloaded in today's educational system, which affects schools' efforts in building healthy relationships with the populations they serve. The categories above are heavily influenced by information overloads and the requirement to multi-task that permeates the modern educational system (Zarra, 2013). For students, it involves excessive pressure from the school system and even parents linked with remembering large amounts of subject-specific information, performing well on tests, and engaging in dissimilar activities to succeed (Zarra, 2013). The need to develop new IT and software use competencies aside from polishing their subject-related knowledge and managing school-family interactions can create an excessive workload on teachers. For today's parents, supporting children in their educational endeavors can be challenging due to an imperfect work-life balance and household management activities. Moreover, the recent popularization of distance learning might create additional responsibilities for parents, including controlling the student's learning process. Schedules and culture support schools' relationships with students and parents to a great extent. As for the schedules, the use of relational time frames enables teachers to dedicate the right amount of time to class activities without overburdening children (Zarra, 2013). With schedules developed to reflect students' needs, the latter have the opportunity to participate in",
        "The book, \u201cCoaching habit: Say less, ask more & change the way you lead forever\u201d, is by Stanier M. Bungay. The publication was released in 2016 through Box of Crayons Press. The author and publishers claim that they give \u201cmanagers practical tools so they can coach in ten minutes or less\u201d (Bungay, 2016, p. 1). One major argument that comes up is that silence does not mean lack of knowledge or disrespect. This element has been stresses in some chapters of the book due to the fact that a significant majority of managers often associate silence to some level of disrespect. According to the scholar, many times, silence might also suggest a critical and keen thought process. Notably, the scholar explains that proper coaching would help managers and leaders realize such situations and help in the growth of both the junior staff and his or her supervisor. It can be argued that the author holds a general assumption that coaching only involves the manager. This is due to the fact that significant amount of advice given is directed to the supervisors. The role of the junior staff should also have been explored due to the nature of coaching. He explains that several elements, referred to as question masterclasses are critical for good coaching. The first question, also called the kick start question is critical. The author",
        "An initial reaction rate is an instant rate at the beginning of the response. The graph has the y and x-axis, y stands for the concentration of moles per liter, and x stands for time in seconds. In this case, the chemical reaction is going against time; at the beginning of the response, the chemical concentration is very high, hence considered a positive reaction. As time goes by, the slope decreases, giving a negative curve; therefore, the reactant concentration reduces within an interval of time. Instantaneous rate is an instant rate in time with differential rate, the reactant against time. The instant calculation is by determining the negativity of the slope and the curve for the concentration of the moles per liter against time in seconds (Du et al., 2021 p 3154). Rate is equal to the negativity of the slope over time in seconds; this brings the instant rate and the difference between them, which gives the instantaneous rate. The reaction rate calculates the average over a time interval by dividing the moles' concentration change per liter overtime per seconds' period by time interval. Getting average is by observing the difference in the reactant's concentration using the equation where the brackets mean the attention of the reactant. A minus sign applies when the rate is of a positive number from the previous equation. Nevertheless, the minus sign is not needed to calculate the used products' average rates. Getting the average from B to G is by adding all the concentration intervals",
        "A lot of historical events and time periods have specific names. The renaissance, the enlightenment, the stone age \u2013 all of these were called such for a particular reason, and signify a way to differentiate one era from another. One prime example of that trend is the industrial revolution. Also called the industrialization, it was an important part of history and a big step in both technological and social development. Happening at a never-before seen speed, the process has begun and ended in less than a 100 years. The word \u201crevolution\u201d in \u201cindustrial revolution\u201d is used to emphasize that fact, and note that the process is regarded as both an extreme and quick advancement in society (Industrial revolution). Like a real revolution, it also had a variety of effects on people and their lives. By changing the way work is performed and understood, it fundamentally shifted the people's understanding of the economy, labor, and the world itself, driving both positive and negative change. For entrepreneurs and people starting their own businesses, the industrialization became a central source of focus and income, replacing the manual labor of people. It also created opportunities for new types of production and large scale manufacturing to be performed. The introduction of complex machinery profoundly affected the workers as well, driving the unskilled labor out of fashion and requiring a higher degree of",
        "Panama is a developing country with a fast-growing economy located in Central America. It has one of the highest GDPs in Latin America but is not devoid of domestic economic problems, such as income inequality and poverty. This paper aims to review two current news articles about Panama, which reveal the issue of the high unemployment rate in this country, which continues to increase and has taken the form of a crisis. The first article appeared in a Panama news outlet called Newsroom Panama. It reports that, in 2021, 108,975 people in Panama were searching for a job, and the unemployment rates among women were higher than among men (Newsroom Panama, 2022). Unemployment results from a lack of new jobs, and the government has to pay subsidies to its citizens to help them survive (Newsroom Panama, 2022). This article is consistent with my findings that, despite fast economic growth, Panama has been experiencing increasing unemployment rates in recent years. The second article was published in Valley Post and is entitled \u201cJob Creation is a Challenge for Panama.\u201d It reports that COVID-19 has significantly affected employment in the tourism, retail, real estate, and construction sectors in Panama (Arzu, 2022). This source is consistent with my findings that the",
        "The article represents an overview of other literature on methodologies and criteria used in supplier evaluation and selection process, which is believed to be one of the vital components of a successful operation of a manufacturing company. In particular, the paper emphasized the industry's change in this field \u2013 from focusing primarily on operational efficiency to embracing the potential of strategic partnerships. The article claims that the right approach to supplier assessment, thus, is the key to a company's development and progress. The paper starts with various ways to address the issues related to MCDM of suppliers' selection. The most common ones are stated to be mathematical models, Simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART), analytic network process (ANP), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), data envelopment analysis (DEA), linear programming, and some others. For example, DEA is a methodology focused on a supplier system and classifies it either as efficient or inefficient based on selecting particular criteria. Mathematical programming models usually incorporate complex evaluations between suppliers, allowing one to compare them and identify the most optimal in terms of cost and other criteria. The article further compares all methodologies by their popularity expressed in the frequency of mentions in the literature. Thus, DEA is the most common approach with 30% mentions, whereas mathematical programming (17%), AHP (15%), and case-based reasoning account for fewer mentions. However, those methodologies represent the largest share of all MCDM approaches. The article highlights the significance of knowing this distribution,",
        "The introduction of new levels of nursing education is a major reform that has contributed to the complexity of the field. Traditionally, nursing schools provided degrees of a Bachelor's level associated with the basic skills required by this profession. However, today, aspiring nurses have access to high-quality Master's programs that further develop their competencies. In this regard, a question may reasonably arise regarding the actual value of such degrees. In fact, Master's programs in nursing are essential for healthcare, as they align with the growing importance of nurses and the contemporary view of the system. Bachelor's degrees provide students with the basics of the profession, its fundamental concepts and practical skills. These aspects alone form a full-fledged, competent nurse who is capable of doing their job. In other words, a Bachelor's degree cannot be considered an \u201cincomplete\u201d education in nursing. At the same time, Master's programs serve as the development impetus for those who want to engage with more sophisticated principles of 21 st -century nursing. First of all, Master's degrees are aimed at the manner in which nurses think. More specifically, such programs promote critical thinking and cognitive agility that is required to make precise decisions in difficult",
        "The four goals of anti-bias education are forming identity, promoting diversity, teaching justice, and fostering activism. Identity formation presupposes that each child sees himself or herself as an individuum who associates himself with a certain family group. Diversity presupposes learning to respect differences between individuals and cultures. Teaching justice means teaching children to understand where wrong is done and to behave respectfully to all people (Derman-Sparks & Edwards, 2019). Activism is about educating children to be self-confident and not afraid to speak out for themselves. These goals are valuable since they allow us to educate people who will respect others, be responsible for their actions, and be ready to call attention to the wrongs that are done. The challenges of anti-bias education are making children behave respectfully even to those individuals they may not like, overcoming shyness in class, and teaching them to differentiate between right and wrong. When I was a child, I was very shy and it was a challenge for me to speak out for myself. What helped me to cope was the friendly atmosphere created in class and the respect for differences instilled in us by our teacher. Sometimes teachers can be biased too and not realize it. Some teachers may give better marks to students they",
        "Social responsibility entails policies that organizations put in place as part of a company's governance projected to ensure the corporate's functions are effective and beneficial to all stakeholders. These guidelines help protect the environment, improve the quality of life for societies, and provide a conducive working environment through recognizing and appreciating talented and hardworking employees. This increases customer loyalty as clients feel they are helping the business support worthy initiatives, thus, enabling more access to funds and allowing more investors to join and support the company. The business rewards employees through meaningful praises, which makes them appreciated. It provides workers a chance to lead by example while giving them the capacity to make decisions without interference, demonstrating that they are trusted and capable (Yang et al., 2019). Additional monetary motivations comprise yearly or semi-yearly bonuses. Additionally, paid time-off and cash prizes help to boost performance while encouraging feelings. The company exercises CSR by adopting a business code of ethics, which shapes workers' behavior on morals, standards, environment, self-esteem, and customer service. The organization has established dependable systems to protect staff and avoid accidents and injuries (Tamvada, 2020). It also ensures suppliers are aware of and meet the expectations of responsible conduct concerning",
        "In order to be successful as an organization, its managers and employees should devote themselves to certain principles and seek to fulfill them in real life. In this regard, Fisher (2008) suggests ten principles that, in the author's opinion, should be central for any entity. Nina, the Administrator of an outpatient dialysis facility, emphasized three core business principles, namely decide who you serve, manage employees, and decide what makes you different, which helped her run the facility successfully. As for the former, deciding whom to serve is a crucial step as it determines the focus of a company's activities. Secondly, managing employees ensures that medical professionals are constantly devoted to improving the quality of work and providing patient-centered care. Finally, deciding what makes you different ensures that the company makes constant improvements in regard to its performance and also establishes core values that can make them the most reliable and trustworthy facility. According to Nina, their mission statement is \u201cTo be the Provider, Partner and Employer of Choice.\u201d This correlates with the principles perfectly since every factor receives attention. The facility strives to provide opportunities and training services to their employees incorporating proper mental, physical, and holistic treatment of patients, which helps not only focus",
        "Medical institutions function to protect the interests of patients and meet their needs; they are now the object of attention of society as a whole. The population's confidence in the activities of medical organizations is an essential indicator of their effectiveness. Bringing current terminology and the nature of the relationship between patients and physicians into a state of certainty will help to understand and delineate the nature of consumerism in health care (Calnal, 2010). The absence or lack of trust is of particular concern to patients. They feel vulnerable not only because they are sick but also because of the research and treatment they have to undergo. Improving the efficiency of the health care system is a policy priority for European countries. In today's world, patients expect adequate professional skills from doctors and high standards of interpersonal communication. In recent years, they have become more aware of medical options and the kind of care they can receive at specific medical organizations. Patients are increasingly comparing options at different clinics, learning a lot of information about doctors and medical services, as well as publicly available information about diseases (Calnan, 2010). The shortcomings of medical care, not the assertive consumerism, are causing the growing interest in self-education among patients. A negative consequence of this trend is the widespread use by patients of Internet materials for self-diagnosis and treatment. The vulnerability of patients undergoing treatment can be",
        "Theodore Roosevelt was one of the youngest American presidents known for his progressive ideas and the desire to change society, addressing the existing distrust and helplessness. The decision to promote progressive ideas was not spontaneous, and he saw the movement as the possibility to protect the real rule of humans (Roosevelt, 1912). The characteristics of a progressive are the intention to stand for social justice, achieve good for all people, and improve the environment in which individuals should grow and develop. Being a progressive means being optimistic about every initiative and participating in problem-solving processes. There is no need to hide behind or keep silent but to act and become passionate about changes and transformations. Despite the desire to support progressive thoughts, there are also some examples of anti-progressives. Roosevelt (1912) called them the people with narrow vision and little sympathy. Anti-progressives are never stirred by the mistakes or failures made by other people (Roosevelt, 1912). Individuals who are consumed by their selfishness are not able to appeal to conscience. Everything they can do is to support oppression and use reforms that work for the leaders' success, not the public one. The activities varied from employees' exploitation to the promotion of capitalism that bounded society and imposed limitations on creativity and progress. Roosevelt wanted to make people believe in his ideas and goals. Thus, he described progressivism as the movement that aimed at underling the real rules and",

The report by Grech and Camilleri (2017) provides insight into applications of blockchain in education, which are \u201cstill in their infancy\u201d (p. 8). The authors emphasize the numerous benefits and social advantages that this concept can bring into the academic setting. Grech and Camilleri (2017) state that \u201cwithin education, activities likely to be disrupted by blockchain technology include the award of qualifications, licensing and accreditation, management of student records, intellectual property management and payments\u201d (p. 8). Although the application of blockchain in the educational field is still underdeveloped, this technology can disrupt the student information systems market and offer numerous benefits for society. The open implementation of blockchain technology can enable the automatization of such processes as achievement record verification, certificate validation, and license issuing. Overall, Grech and Camilleri (2017) offer \u201ceight scenarios for the application of the Blockchain in an education context, based on the current state of technology development and deployment\u201d (p. 95). In particular, it can be used to secure certificates, verify accreditation, recognize and transfer credits automatically, and store lifelong learning passports.

        "According to Lufkin (2021), there is an urgent need to reduce the impact on physical and digital presenteeism in the era of pandemic and social transformations. This article focuses on the importance of recognizing true motives for presenteeism and defines the impact of subconscious biases on employee relationships. At the same time, the mere exposure and halo effects are associated with unfair or ineffective promotions that determine the quality of work. The idea that many biases unreasonably support presenteeism and negatively contribute to performance is correct, and differentiating employees' achievements using favors seems questionable. Presenteeism is problematic because most people continue addressing their subconscious beliefs about professional growth. Lufkin (2021) notices that not all employees can come to work early and leave late to demonstrate their devotion to the organization. Some people set priorities instead of achieving work-life balance and succeeding as an employee and a parent. They believe that their presence at the workplace helps get promotions or rewards, but the pandemic restrictions have already proved that remote work may be effective. Such attitudes towards presenteeism discourage and impose obligations that hardly improve performance. However, the attention to the halo and mere exposure effects provokes",

In particular, it is the situation around Tangie, who was raped by her grandfather (Perry, 2010). Below, the assessments, implementation, and education within the scope of a care plan will be provided. Initially, it will be essential to evaluate Tangie's mental state, which can be done after a series of conversations. The latter ones should be conducted with Tangie and her closest people who can shed light on the situation. It is expected that the ones involved will share several details on how the mentioned type of abuse took place, as well as what Tangie is likely to feel now. After this information is obtained, the care plan is to be developed and implemented. The first stage will imply regular conversations with Tangie that will cover the themes of her feelings and view of the tragedy. Then, it will be important to enroll her in a group of those who have been raped that she will attend on a weekly basis. Tangie should feel support around her so that she could abandon the sense of loneliness. This might diminish the possibility of constant depression and avert some severe mental traumas."

        "Circumstances and Encountered Issues In the case study presented, the overall setting surrounding the Asian Health Services (AHS) corporation appears to put additional pressure on the enterprise's executives. AHS is a prosperous organization that was able to process over 117,000 patient visits in 2014 and possessed seven sites in addition to three owned properties (Chung & Chin, 2015). However, with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the situation changed drastically, creating both advantages and disadvantages for AHS. Although ACA increased patient supply, the medical organization encountered a significant challenge when introducing **new billing and compliance procedures mandated by the expanded insurance coverage. The shift from a largely fee-for-service model to one emphasizing value-based care and bundled payments required a complete overhaul of their financial and operational systems. This necessitated significant investment in staff training, updated IT infrastructure, and the development of robust data analytics capabilities to track patient outcomes and cost efficiencies. Moreover, while patient volume increased, a considerable number of these newly insured individuals presented with complex, chronic conditions, demanding more comprehensive care coordination and longer appointment times, thereby straining existing resources. The core challenge was not just managing volume, but adapting to a fundamentally different healthcare landscape where financial viability increasingly depended on demonstrating quality and managing population health effectively, placing immense pressure on AHS to innovate rapidly.**",
        "One of the social factors that might impact what groceries are purchased is the lack of healthy food. Addressing Wal-Mart in Forest Part allows me to gather enough information about available products and their prices. For example, one gallon of great value milk is $2.65, one loaf of Sara Lee bread is $2.44, one bag of gala apples is $3.58, and one bag of organic baby carrots is $3.88. Continuing my visit, the prices are as follows: one yogurt container is $1.92, 2-liter of Pepsi Soda is $2.18, and a large bag of potato chips is $3.99.\n\nThis snapshot of prices reveals a crucial aspect of food accessibility. While staple items like milk and bread are relatively affordable, the cost difference between fresh produce and highly processed alternatives can be significant. Organic carrots, for instance, are nearly the same price as a large bag of chips, and often more expensive than a sugary drink. For individuals facing budget constraints or living in areas with limited access to full-service grocery stores (food deserts), these price points heavily influence purchasing decisions. The immediate affordability of calorie-dense, less nutritious options often outweighs the long-term benefits of healthier choices. This economic reality contributes directly to the social factor of \"lack of healthy food,\" not just in terms of physical availability, but also in terms of financial accessibility, perpetuating dietary disparities and health challenges within communities.",
        "Every business must be managed carefully, and every detail must receive a fair amount of attention. When it comes to healthcare, such facilities must require even more attention because they focus on people's well-being. Performing such duties might be strenuous and expensive, and mentally demanding. As a Chief Nursing Officer, one will be faced with principles that include integrity maintenance, cash flow management, and employee motivation in the given circumstances. To start with, a healthcare business must always maintain its integrity. It can be evident that any business field should be focused on communication, which makes integrity a vital part of building trust with patients and the community. Without unwavering honesty, the very purpose of healing is compromised, eroding confidence essential for effective care.\n\nRobust cash flow management is equally critical. A CNO must strategically allocate resources for adequate staffing, updated equipment, and essential supplies. Financial stability directly impacts quality care, preventing shortfalls that jeopardize patient safety. Finally, employee motivation is paramount. Nursing is demanding, so a CNO must foster a supportive environment that recognizes hard work, promotes development, and addresses burnout. Motivated staff are more engaged and effective, directly enhancing patient outcomes. Balancing these core principles ensures a healthcare facility remains ethical, sustainable, and capable of fulfilling its primary mission: patient well-being.",
        "Different circumstances under which medical staff has worked led to varying types of leadership strategies being developed. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the role of clear communication and the handling of prompt preparation in top healthcare leaders (Nicola et al., 2020). Another key tactic includes the use of external change agents that ultimately promote excellent organizational decision-making (Alagoz et al., 2018). Moreover, one study explained how implementing positivity-related and open-minded approaches as leaders can improve their employee's resilience, providing an additional source of motivation (Wei et al., 2018). These diverse strategies underscore the dynamic nature of healthcare leadership, demanding adaptability and foresight. During crises like a pandemic, transparent and timely communication becomes paramount, not only to coordinate rapid responses but also to alleviate staff anxiety and foster trust amidst uncertainty. Similarly, leveraging external expertise through change agents can offer unbiased insights, enabling healthcare organizations to address systemic issues, optimize resource allocation, and innovate effectively in a constantly evolving field. Furthermore, fostering a positive and open-minded culture is crucial for long-term staff retention and well-being. By prioritizing psychological safety and encouraging new ideas, leaders empower their teams to navigate demanding environments, reducing burnout and enhancing overall performance. Ultimately, effective medical leadership transcends a single approach, requiring a judicious blend of operational acumen, strategic external engagement, and profound empathy to thrive under any circumstance.",
        "Creating a legal definition for various ages is crucial for lawmakers in America. By establishing the boundaries between childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, it becomes possible to clarify the specifics of such periods and behaviors that the individuals might demonstrate. However, as explained by Scott (2000) in The Legal Construction of Adolescence, there are several complications connected to clearly defining the end of childhood and the overall period of adolescence. While childhood and adulthood ages can be specified by distinguishing between the children's vulnerability and adults' responsibility, adolescent populations' ages are more difficult to determine due to the transitional nature of this growth. This transitional nature often leads to a patchwork of age-based laws, where an individual might be deemed mature enough to drive a car at sixteen, yet legally prohibited from purchasing alcohol until twenty-one, or held criminally responsible as an adult at even younger ages. This inconsistency highlights the inherent difficulty in assigning a single, definitive chronological age to a period marked by profound and varied cognitive, emotional, and social development. Adolescence is not a switch that flips but a gradual process. Consequently, the legal system struggles to reconcile the evolving capacities of young people with the need for clear, enforceable boundaries, often placing adolescents in a complex legal limbo where their rights and responsibilities are inconsistently applied, reflecting society's ongoing debate about when adulthood truly begins.",
        "Retailers, Wholesalers and Manufacturers are three stakeholder groups that can greatly contribute to financial success or failure of a business. All three of them are involved in the supply chains of most middle and large-scale product-oriented businesses. The three groups have certain aspects in common but are drastically different in how they engage with a firm's products and its customers. The differences apply to the amounts of goods a group is dealing with as part of its function, as well as its direct role in the chain. Retailers earn money by acquiring things in bulk at a discount from wholesalers or manufacturers, then selling smaller quantities to the end consumer at a markup. They are the direct interface with customers, influencing sales and brand image. Wholesalers, conversely, bridge manufacturers and retailers, purchasing large volumes and distributing them, impacting product accessibility and cost efficiency. Manufacturers initiate the chain, producing goods and defining their quality and initial cost. The success of a product-oriented business hinges on the seamless interplay of these groups. Manufacturing defects, wholesale distribution inefficiencies, or poor retail engagement can all disrupt the supply chain, leading to unsold inventory, customer dissatisfaction, and financial losses. Conversely, strong collaboration and strategic alignment among retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers are crucial for optimizing operations, reducing costs, and ensuring a steady flow of products, directly contributing to the firm's overall financial prosperity.",
        "The Spirit bear of the British Colony is a unique species of bears that amaze with their appearance and are of particular importance to the population of British Columbia. This type of animal is a kind of Kermode bear and is a subspecies of black bears, which often have dark fur (Service, 2017). However, due to a genetic mutation, some of the representatives of spirit bears have a white coat color, which is why they have such an interesting name (Langlois, 2017). Like many representatives of this species, they weigh an average of two hundred kilograms (Service, 2017). These magnificent creatures primarily inhabit the ancient temperate rainforests of the Great Bear Rainforest, a pristine and ecologically vital region along British Columbia's central coast. Their diet largely consists of salmon, playing a crucial role in the forest ecosystem by dispersing marine nutrients.\n\nBeyond their ecological significance, Spirit bears hold profound cultural and spiritual importance for the Gitga'at and Kitasoo/Xai'xais First Nations, who consider them sacred beings and guardians of the forest. Their rarity and elusive nature contribute to their mystical allure, making sightings a truly special event. However, these iconic bears face ongoing threats from habitat loss, logging, and proposed industrial developments within their delicate ecosystem. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these unique animals and their invaluable habitat, ensuring that the 'ghost bear' continues to roam the ancient forests of British Columbia for generations to come.",
        "Communication and collaboration are crucial elements for the success of any individual and team effort. The first chapter of the book Technical Communication provides insight into the aspects of technical communication and its importance. I discovered that technical communication addresses two main tasks: assisting people in learning about certain phenomena or how to do a certain task. Additionally, technical communication can make others strengthen their attitudes, change them, or even take particular actions. I also found that technical documents reflect organizational culture, are made in collaboration and have distinctive elements, including a particular reader, clear instructions on resolving an issue, design, images, and a strong emphasis on clarity, accuracy, and conciseness.\n\nUnlike general writing, technical documents are meticulously crafted to be easily understood and acted upon by their specific audience, often under time pressure or when facing a problem. This demands careful attention to organization, formatting, and the precise use of language, ensuring that the information is not only present but also accessible and actionable. Furthermore, ethical considerations are paramount, as misleading or incomplete technical information can have serious consequences. Ultimately, successful technical communication, whether a user manual, a report, or a presentation, embodies the principles of effective communication and collaboration, ensuring that knowledge is effectively transferred and and goals are achieved within any organization.",
        "The European powers had taken major parts of the world, including the Caribbean. In the 15 th century, the Europeans claimed the region following the establishment of Spanish settlements and conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires (Horne, 2018). Due to the conquest, it was easy for the Spanish to invade Mexico and Peru through exploration in strategic points of the Caribbean region. Following the Spanish invasion of the Caribbean in the 17th century, other European powers such as the British and French started settling in pivotal points such as the island of Tortuga and later moved to Jamaica (Horne, 2018). The allure of profitable cash crops, particularly sugar, fueled this escalating competition. As the Spanish grip weakened, the British and French established vast sugar plantations, transforming the islands into highly lucrative, yet brutal, colonial enterprises. This agricultural revolution necessitated a massive influx of enslaved African labor, fundamentally reshaping the demographics and societies of the Caribbean. The economic model, built on exploitation, cemented the region's role as a vital cog in the transatlantic trade network. Consequently, the legacy of European colonization in the Caribbean is one of profound cultural hybridity, persistent economic dependency, and enduring social stratification, reflecting centuries of power dynamics and resource extraction that continue to influence the region today.",
        "It is clear to modern people, as well as many people who lived in the 1930s, that the Second World War was inevitable. Some believe that the United States of America could prevent the outbreak of the war. However, this could hardly be possible due to several reasons. The American government maintained an isolationist foreign policy in the 1930s. The period was challenging as all countries had to address severe economic issues (Corbett et al., 2021). Americans wanted to concentrate on domestic matters, including a threatening spread of communist ideas (Russett, 2019). It is noteworthy that the USA could not have effectively intervened to prevent the global conflict, even had it possessed the political will. The nation's profound economic crisis severely hampered any capacity for significant military projection or large-scale financial aid to European powers. Public opinion, deeply scarred by World War I, overwhelmingly favored isolationism, rendering proactive foreign policy politically untenable for the Roosevelt administration. Moreover, the expansionist ambitions of totalitarian regimes in Germany, Italy, and Japan stemmed from deep-seated ideological motivations and grievances that external diplomatic pressure, especially from an inward-focused nation, was unlikely to deter. Thus, while some might speculate about American preventative action, the convergence of domestic priorities, public reluctance, and determined aggression made the Second World War an unavoidable global tragedy.",
        "In order to better understand the higher prevalence of diabetes within the county, it is essential to observe both national and local trends of the illness. According to the CDC (2022), while new cases of diabetes have steadily decreased over the decades, the prevalence of the disease among people aged below twenty has not. Similarly, the prevention and management of diabetes among older adults is largely unsatisfactory and could be vastly improved. A number of socio-cultural factors also influence the prevalence of diabetes. For instance, individuals with Hispanic backgrounds are more prone to have the condition. Other factors such as age, socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare significantly contribute. Lower-income communities often face food deserts, limiting access to fresh produce and promoting reliance on processed foods. Educational attainment also influences health literacy and preventive practices. Within this specific county, it is crucial to investigate the demographic makeup, identifying neighborhoods with higher concentrations of at-risk populations due to age, ethnicity, or economic disadvantage. Understanding the local healthcare infrastructure\u2014availability of primary care and diabetes education programs\u2014is equally vital. Furthermore, assessing community-level initiatives for promoting physical activity and healthy eating can reveal gaps. By meticulously examining these intertwined national trends, local demographics, and socio-environmental determinants, a comprehensive strategy for tackling the county\u2019s elevated diabetes rates can be developed, moving beyond mere statistics to targeted, impactful interventions.",
        "There is a growing number of physicians' encounters with the victims of human trafficking, sometimes even without recognizing them as such. Recently, Todres (2017) reported an incident, where Dr. W was requested to screen the women-employees of such a firm for sexually transmitted infections. On the one hand, according to the Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association (2011), it is necessary to safeguard patient confidentiality, including several aspects, such as physical, informational, decisional, and associational privacy. At the same time, it is obligatory to keep the records of all patient encounters.\n\nThis duality presents a profound ethical quandary for healthcare professionals. In scenarios like Dr. W\u2019s, comprehensive record-keeping, while essential for continuity of care and legal compliance, could inadvertently expose a trafficking victim to further harm if these records fall into the wrong hands or are accessed by their exploiters. Conversely, a lack of documentation might hinder future intervention or legal action. Physicians are uniquely positioned to identify signs of abuse, but without specific training, these indicators often go unnoticed, masked by routine medical complaints. Therefore, while upholding confidentiality is paramount, there\u2019s an urgent need for enhanced education on recognizing trafficking red flags and developing protocols that balance ethical obligations with the imperative to protect vulnerable individuals and facilitate their escape from exploitation.",
        "The foundation myths of Rome represent some of the qualities vital for a successful state in antiquity \u2013 decisiveness, militancy, and political and social flexibility. Historians of different sorts have been trying to understand and interpret the story of Romulus and Remus since its creation. The following stages of Rome's supposed history also raise many questions regarding fratricide, abduction, rape, and also the backgrounds of Rome's first citizens. The fact that according to most of the myths, Rome started from fratricide seems to be quite relevant as the city's history is famously filled with fratricide and internal strife. The violent birth, marked by Romulus's killing of Remus, seems to foreshadow the Republic's brutal civil wars and the Empire's often bloody successions. The abduction of the Sabine women, while morally reprehensible, highlights Rome's pragmatic approach to growth, integrating outsiders through force and then assimilation, a pattern repeated throughout its expansion. This foundational violence, far from being a mere narrative embellishment, arguably reflects a deeper truth about Roman character: a willingness to employ ruthless ambition and aggression for the sake of the state's survival and dominance. The myths, therefore, are not just origin stories but allegories, revealing the DNA of a civilization built on conquest, internal power struggles, and an unyielding will to prevail, no matter the human cost. They serve as a stark reminder that greatness, for Rome, was often forged in the crucible of conflict and moral compromise.",
        "Portraying the lives of gods and depicting relationships between them, as well as their interactions with humans, both \u201cIliad\u201d and \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d elaborate on the theme of power abuse by those at the helm. In \u201cIliad,\u201d Agamemnon has to face retribution due to his constant abuse of power: \u201cbe ready, that I be not left,/Alone of all the Greeks, without my prize\u201d (Homer, 762 B. C.). Likewise, in Ovid\u2019s \u201cMetamorphoses,\u201d the divine pantheon frequently demonstrates unchecked authority, often at the expense of mortals. Jupiter, the king of the gods, is a prime perpetrator, using his supremacy to indulge in countless affairs, transforming mortals like Io into a heifer to conceal his infidelity from Juno, or relentlessly pursuing Callisto. Beyond Jupiter, the gods\u2019 whims dictate human fate, turning individuals into trees, animals, or constellations as punishment, protection, or mere sport. This unchecked power is visible in the tragic tale of Arachne, whose unparalleled weaving skill provokes Athena\u2019s envy. Rather than acknowledging human talent, Athena punishes Arachne\u2019s perceived arrogance by transforming her into a spider, a brutal display of divine insecurity and the devastating consequences of challenging those in power. Both epics thus serve as cautionary tales, highlighting the corrupting nature of absolute power and the vulnerability of those subject to it.",
        "The rate of patient mortality in intensive care is a growing concern for medical practitioners. Although the cause of patient motility may be attributed to many factors even before the individual reaches the CCU, it has been reported that an effective tube placement during resuscitation aids healthy circulation. It is not known if the nurse's knowledge of capnography affects its use in critical care units. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the relationship between nurses' knowledge of capnography and its use in coronary care units. The project will provide valuable insight into factors affecting the use of capnography, thus **informing targeted educational interventions and policy changes aimed at enhancing patient safety and outcomes.**\n\nCapnography, a non-invasive monitoring technique, offers real-time data on a patient's ventilatory status and circulatory effectiveness by measuring exhaled carbon dioxide. Its utility transcends simple tube placement confirmation, extending to early detection of respiratory compromise, cardiac arrest, and metabolic disturbances. However, the full potential of this technology can only be realized when healthcare professionals, especially nurses who are at the bedside, possess a comprehensive understanding of its principles and clinical applications. A clear connection between knowledge and utilization could highlight critical gaps in current training programs. By identifying barriers to effective capnography use, this research paves the way for improved patient management protocols, potentially leading to a reduction in adverse events and, ultimately, a decrease in mortality rates within critical care settings. This foundational understanding is essential for advancing evidence-based practice.",
        "The phrase that caught me most from the video is from Isaiah, stating that Samuel has taught him that one person can play t-ball and hit it hard when sitting down. This is a powerful statement indicating that people can be prejudiced despite having good intentions. Samuel's family did not realize the struggles disabled people go through before he was born (PinehurstPictures, 2010). The child's image hitting the t-ball also showcased a powerful issue, that disabled individuals should be treated similarly to other people and given equal opportunities to give them the chance to perform optimally. I was struck by the raw honesty of Isaiah's confession, highlighting a common, often unconscious, form of prejudice. It\u2019s easy to assume limitations for others based on our perceptions, even when our hearts are in the right place. Samuel\u2019s existence forced a fundamental shift in his family\u2019s understanding, revealing the invisible barriers and biases that society inadvertently erects. The t-ball scene isn\u2019t just about a game; it\u2019s a profound metaphor for inclusion. It demonstrates that with the right adaptations and an open mind, perceived \u2018disabilities\u2019 often transform into unique abilities, given the chance. This powerful lesson underscores the importance of actively challenging our preconceptions and striving to create a world where every individual, regardless of their physical or mental makeup, is afforded the dignity of equal access and the opportunity to truly excel.",
        "Slavery has been one of the most problematic aspects of the history of humankind. Slavery developed as European trading and marine settlements which required additional labor in the American colonies (Harris, 2018). Settlers comprised enslaved people from Native Americans and forcibly brought Africans, using slave labor in every part of the economy, from sugar production to harvesting and exploration of raw materials (Harris, 2018). The practice of slavery in British North America can be characterized by how colonists regarded enslaved people. As slavery gradually spread across America, each area had distinctions. For instance, Jamestown in Virginia became the first permanent English settlement in North America, and it was here, in 1619, that the first documented Africans arrived, initially as indentured servants rather than lifelong slaves. However, this distinction quickly eroded. As the colony's tobacco economy boomed, the demand for cheap, perpetual labor intensified, leading to the systematic codification of laws that stripped Africans and their descendants of all rights, solidifying their status as chattel property. This transformation in Virginia set a grim precedent, influencing the development of similar brutal systems throughout the other colonies. The foundational practices established in places like Jamestown laid the groundwork for the deeply entrenched, race-based slavery that would define much of American history, leaving an indelible scar on the nation's social and economic fabric for centuries to come.",
        "A Western scholarship has distorted the long history of African culture for centuries, and many of its basic principles have been viewed through the lens of colonization. As a result, the ideas and tenets of African philosophy have been appropriated and changed in value from the inherent parts of people's nature into commodities. In their works, p'Bitek and Marimba discuss such concepts as culture, spirituality, and philosophy of African nations and how Western ideology has reshaped their presentation without fully understanding their meaning. The commodification of African culture and the imposition of European views on the distinction between culture and spirituality has profoundly alienated Africans from their own heritage. p'Bitek, for instance, critiques the Eurocentric gaze that reduces vibrant African traditions to mere 'folklore' or 'primitive' practices, thereby stripping them of their philosophical depth and spiritual significance. Similarly, Marimba argues that the Western academic framework often fails to grasp the holistic nature of African thought, where spirituality, community, and daily life are inextricably linked, not compartmentalized as in many Western paradigms. This reinterpretation has led to a devaluation, transforming profound belief systems into exotic curiosities for external consumption. The true challenge lies in decolonizing these narratives, allowing African voices to reclaim and redefine their cultural and philosophical legacies, free from the distortions of an imposed foreign lens and the demands of a global market.",
        "Olivier Armantier's et al. article, \u201cHow Economic Crises Affect Inflation Beliefs: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic,\u201d was published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization on July 24, 2021. Publisher Elsevier has partnered with the Copyright Center RightsLink service to offer various options for reusing this content. Elsevier offers open or restricted access to content with permanently unique identifiers to include links and citations. This paper is an independent article focusing on the state of the public economy during COVID-19. In their paper, the authors meticulously analyze how the unprecedented economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic influenced individual perceptions of inflation. They leverage extensive survey data, including the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations, to explore the formation and evolution of inflation beliefs during a period of extreme uncertainty. Their findings reveal a significant increase in disagreement among individuals regarding future inflation, indicating a divergence of expectations that contrasts with more typical periods of economic stability. This heightened uncertainty and fragmentation in beliefs have profound implications for monetary policy effectiveness, as central banks rely on predictable public expectations to guide their actions. The research underscores how non-traditional economic shocks, like a global pandemic, can severely test conventional economic models and highlight the critical role of behavioral factors in economic outcomes. Understanding these shifts is crucial for policymakers aiming to maintain price stability and ensure economic resilience in the face of future crises.",
        "The global pandemic caused by the COVID-19 has led to severe issues in the labor market. To be more particular, the number of unemployed individuals is considerably higher than prior to the global lockdown (The Economist, para. 2). Naturally, such a situation happened due to businesses going bankrupt or reducing the number of employees to survive the economic crisis. The Economist elaborates on the statistics of the unemployment rate and shares the amount of time it can take for the labor market to recover to its prior-pandemic state (para. 1-3). This issue is complex, extending beyond mere statistics to encompass profound societal and individual challenges. The recovery, as The Economist suggests, isn't simply a matter of time; it involves adapting to structural shifts, such as accelerated automation and the expansion of the gig economy. Furthermore, the psychological toll on long-term unemployed individuals, coupled with potential skill mismatches as industries transform, poses significant hurdles. Governments face the daunting task of implementing effective retraining programs and robust social safety nets to mitigate these effects. Ultimately, a true recovery will necessitate a re-evaluation of traditional employment models and a concerted effort to foster resilience and adaptability within the workforce, shaping a \"new normal\" that is far from a simple return to the pre-pandemic era.",
        "Economic globalization is an inevitable process due to many reasons, but many people argue that it has a detrimental effect on the development of many countries or even the entire world. Nevertheless, globalization positively influences the evolution of human society at large, although some adverse effects are apparent (Wade, 2004). First, it is essential to understand the benefits of economic globalization to embrace it rather than try to oppose it. Undoubtedly, economic globalization enables people to trade more efficiently and effectively as they have access to diverse resources and markets. An entrepreneur in every part of the world can offer products and services to people in distant lands, fostering unprecedented market expansion and consumer choice. This interconnectedness fuels competition, driving innovation and efficiency as companies strive to meet global demands, often leading to lower prices and higher quality goods. Beyond mere commerce, globalization facilitates the rapid transfer of knowledge, technology, and cultural ideas across borders, accelerating scientific advancements and fostering cross-cultural understanding. While concerns about job displacement, environmental impact, and equitable wealth distribution are valid and require careful policy responses, the overall trajectory points towards greater global prosperity and interdependence. Embracing this reality, with robust governance, allows humanity to harness globalization\u2019s potential for collective progress, leveraging its benefits to uplift societies worldwide rather than retreat into isolation.",
        "The \u201cEye of the Storm\u201d video is a fascinating example of how race can be socially constructed in the classroom. Jane Elliott created a distinction between blue-eyed and brown-eyed children, teaching the young participants that their peers with brown eyes were superior (Bloom). Although this contrast does not possess any inherent meaning and is merely a representation of one's amount of melanin in the body, it became significant for the children. Thus, Elliott socially constructed race by suggesting that one group of children is better than the other, with the eye colors serving as symbols to emphasize race and group identity.\n\nWithin moments, this arbitrary distinction transformed into a tangible social hierarchy. The \"superior\" brown-eyed children quickly exhibited arrogance and discriminatory behavior towards their blue-eyed classmates, who, in turn, became withdrawn, demoralized, and even performed worse on academic tasks. This rapid shift vividly demonstrated how easily an insignificant physical trait can be imbued with profound social meaning, leading to real-world consequences like prejudice and systemic disadvantage. Elliott\u2019s experiment powerfully illustrates that race, far from being a biological constant, is a fluid social construct, heavily influenced by authority and societal narratives. It underscores the profound impact of perceived status on individual behavior and the urgent need to dismantle such constructed hierarchies in our society, fostering genuine equity and understanding.",
        "The differences between the Persian and Greek cultures can be seen in several traditions and customs. In Persia, the distinction between different religions and languages was accepted by the society, allowing people from the conquered territories to continue practicing their ancestral traditions without being persecuted (Brooks, 2019). In contrast, Greeks were less tolerant of other religions and cultures, enforcing submission to Greek customs from the populations residing in their territory (Brooks, 2019). Another significant dissimilarity was the citizens' attitude toward the authority, with the Persian residents voluntarily supporting the King and remaining strongly loyal to him (Brooks, 2019). Conversely, the Greeks, particularly Athenians, valued direct civic participation and self-governance, often viewing absolute monarchy with suspicion. Their political landscape was characterized by a diverse array of city-states, each experimenting with different forms of government, from oligarchy to democracy, where citizens actively debated and voted on laws rather than passively accepting royal decrees (Brooks, 2019). This fundamental difference in political philosophy extended to their societal structures; Persian society was highly stratified with the King at its apex, while Greek societies, especially democratic ones, fostered a greater sense of individual agency and public discourse among their citizens. These contrasting approaches to governance, religion, and social cohesion fundamentally shaped the unique identities of these two powerful ancient civilizations.",
        "The main difference with regard to various gender theories is how they explain the gendered differences in behaviors characteristic for both sexes. When applied to the issue of behavioral problems in males, different theories find their causes in different sources. Biological determinism would explain behavioral issues in male students through the concept of male nature as inherently and naturally competitive, aggressive, and even violent (Tilling, 2013). However, this essentialist theory is at odds with the now well-established understanding that, while some people are predisposed toward delinquency, social influences are a far more prominent cause thereof. Rather than an inherent \u2018male nature,\u2019 theories like social constructionism highlight how societal expectations of masculinity \u2013 emphasizing stoicism, dominance, and a suppression of emotion \u2013 can contribute to maladaptive coping mechanisms. Boys are often socialized to be aggressive or dismissive of vulnerability, leading to conflict when these norms clash with healthy social interaction. Factors such as peer group dynamics, family structures, media representation, and educational environments significantly shape behavioral outcomes. A nuanced perspective acknowledges biological predispositions but ultimately prioritizes the powerful impact of social learning and environmental factors in shaping male behavior, offering more effective avenues for intervention and support than deterministic views.",
        "Diana Kendall claims the current perception of the class has been a construct of the media and based on the construction, the meaning of class is determined. Kendall argues that the media has legitimized inequality in the United States through the assumption, with television programs and newspaper articles creating and reifying class-based stereotypes. Furthermore, Kendall argues that class discussions in the media are rarely explicit; however, their portrayals generate perspectives that impact human behavior. The upper class in society is portrayed positively, while the lower class is framed negatively. On the one hand, the upper class contains individuals that should be admired and emulated, often depicted as intelligent, industrious, and deserving of their wealth. Their success is presented as a result of meritocracy, reinforcing the idea that anyone can achieve similar status through hard work. Conversely, the lower class is frequently framed negatively, associated with laziness, lack of ambition, or poor decision-making. Such portrayals subtly imply that their struggles are self-inflicted, thereby absolving systemic issues and discouraging empathy. This constant, albeit often implicit, media narrative normalizes vast economic disparities. By consistently presenting the wealthy as aspirational and the poor as problematic, the media not only shapes public perception of class but also subtly influences individual behavior, from consumer choices to political opinions, ultimately cementing a societal acceptance of inequality as a natural rather than constructed outcome.",
        "Terrorism is one of the main problems faced by humanity in the 21st century and, despite considerable countermeasures, it remains topical. Islamic terrorism is one of the most prominent forms of the radicalism of the past decades, which manifested itself in several tragic events. The movement began when Osama Bin Laden formed al Qaeda in 1989, which conducted its first attack in Yemen by placing a bomb in a hotel housing American troops (\u201cOsama bin Laden,\u201d 2020). Osama Bin Laden espoused the idea of worldwide Jihad, a holy war of Muslims against the infidels and especially the United States, which he viewed as the primary oppressor of Muslim lands and peoples. This extremist interpretation of Jihad, twisting a concept of internal struggle or defensive warfare into a justification for indiscriminate violence, became the ideological bedrock for Al-Qaeda's horrific campaign. The 1998 embassy bombings in Africa and, most devastatingly, the September 11, 2001 attacks on American soil, epitomized this violent ideology, claiming thousands of innocent lives and fundamentally altering global security. Bin Laden\u2019s vision aimed to provoke a wider clash of civilizations, expel Western influence from the Middle East, and establish a global caliphate. While Al-Qaeda's leadership has been significantly degraded, the dangerous legacy of this radical ideology persists, inspiring splinter groups and lone actors, making the fight against such terrorism a complex and enduring challenge for the international community.",
        "A trade secret is one of the most valuable components of a company's functioning, which can provide it with a significant competitive advantage. Hence, it consists in confidential information that describes the processes or things that characterize the organization. It can be a phrase, a slogan, a symbol, or a mixture of these aspects. To qualify for a trademark, the information must correspond to specific points. It must have commercial value for the company, must be known to a limited number of people, and fall under such documents as consent to conceal data for the persons by whom it is used. Unlike a patent or a registered trademark, a trade secret offers perpetual protection as long as its confidentiality is maintained. This lack of a fixed expiry date is a key distinction, providing a continuous competitive edge without the need for public disclosure required by patent applications. However, this perpetual nature comes with a caveat: if the secret is independently discovered or reverse-engineered by competitors, its legal protection ceases. Companies therefore invest heavily in robust internal security measures, non-disclosure agreements with employees and partners, and strict access controls to safeguard these invaluable assets. The true power of a trade secret lies not in its registration, but in its absolute secrecy, making vigilant protection paramount for sustaining innovation and market leadership.",
        "Commitment to health theory is a special model designed to determine the stages of development and behavior changes. This theory assumes the development of an internal state, as well as the acceptance of the desire to lead a healthy lifestyle under the conditions that any circumstances may limit a person. Moreover, with the help of this theory, the necessary level is determined, which indicates a particular stage of human health (Kelly, 2014). In addition, this theory assumes that there are no established differences, such as gender, race, and others, in order to build behavior aimed at developing a healthy lifestyle. In essence, the theory posits that the journey towards a healthier lifestyle is fundamentally an individual psychological process, unhindered by external labels. It emphasizes that intrinsic motivation and the internal commitment to change are paramount. By identifying an individual's current stage \u2013 whether pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, or maintenance \u2013 practitioners can tailor interventions that resonate with their specific readiness for change. This personalized approach, devoid of demographic biases, makes the Commitment to Health Theory a powerful tool for promoting sustained behavioral shifts across diverse populations. Its strength lies in recognizing the universal human capacity for self-improvement and adapting strategies to foster that inherent drive, ultimately empowering individuals to overcome personal barriers and achieve optimal well-being.",
        "The article of Zulaika (2022) presents the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on adolescent pregnancy and school dropout among secondary school girls in Kenya. The cases of teenage pregnancy started in Kenya after the country-wide school closure that started from March 2020 and lasted until January 2021. Zulaika (2022) examine to what extent the pandemic affected sexual and reproductive health of adolescents in Rarieda subcounty. The study shows there was a limited involvement of health administrators on the issue of pregnancy among school girls. Teenagers lack sexual education and are not adequately equipped with the knowledge or resources to make informed decisions about their sexual and reproductive health. This vulnerability was exacerbated by the lockdowns, which removed girls from the protective school environment and disrupted access to vital health services. Confined at home, often facing economic hardships and increased exposure to risks, many adolescents became susceptible to early sexual encounters. The study\u2019s finding of limited health administrator involvement underscores a critical systemic oversight during an unprecedented crisis. Without proactive outreach and accessible support, young girls were left to navigate complex challenges alone. These unintended pregnancies often resulted in permanent school withdrawal, perpetuating cycles of poverty and severely limiting future opportunities. Zulaika (2022) highlights the urgent need for comprehensive sexual education and responsive healthcare systems that prioritize adolescent well-being, especially when traditional support structures are disrupted.",
        "The adjustment process of new children and their parents can be challenging for them and the teacher. An educator can implement many educational and communicational techniques to ease the process and support the children and parents. I believe that maintaining constant communication with parents through conferences or phone calls, with the consideration of their time and privacy, is one of the most important elements. Encouraging home learning activities and welcoming parents into the classroom is also crucial. Most parents would like to be involved in or informed about their children's adjustment in a new classroom. Gaining parents' trust by properly communicating with them and demonstrating genuine care for their child's well-being are fundamental. When parents feel heard and supported, they are more likely to partner with the teacher, creating a consistent and nurturing environment for the child. This collaboration extends beyond academics, encompassing emotional and social development. Regular updates on the child's progress, challenges, and successes, coupled with practical advice for home support, can significantly reduce anxiety for both parents and children. Ultimately, a strong parent-teacher relationship, built on mutual respect and open dialogue, forms the bedrock for a smooth transition and ensures the child feels secure and ready to learn in their new educational setting.",
        "Both lookism and extreme body modification are inherently linked to unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standards of modern society. This trait aside, however, the two are very different in its manifestations and direct consequences. Lookism is merely the act of considering someone whose appearance is not what most people would regard to be beautiful. It focuses on exhibiting negative judgement to people that do not fit the standard and is thus oriented outside of the person who engages in it. Extreme body modification is the act of changing one's body in order to look in a way that deviates from the norms that society sets on appearance.\n\nThis outward orientation of lookism can lead to systemic discrimination, affecting individuals' opportunities in employment, education, and social acceptance simply based on their looks. It fosters a culture of superficiality and can severely impact the mental well-being and self-esteem of those deemed \"unattractive.\" Conversely, extreme body modification, while often a personal choice, stems from a complex interplay of self-expression, a desire to belong to a subculture, or even a desperate attempt to gain control over one's body in a world obsessed with appearance. Its consequences are primarily internal and physical, ranging from health risks to social alienation, ironically, sometimes *because* the modification itself deviates from mainstream beauty ideals. While lookism enforces conformity by punishing deviation, body modification often embodies a radical departure, yet both underscore society's pervasive obsession with appearance.",
        "Frankenstein possesses both positive and negative traits that help readers build his character. The main hero can be looked at from diverse perspectives; therefore, the creation of Frankenstein's character can be seen as believable or even sympathetic. Due to his life difficulties, such as losing many of his family members or friends, Frankenstein is generally pitied by the majority of the audience. Later, the reader can understand that the main hero feels quite lonely and pays much attention to his research and studies to cover this inner loneliness caused by the loss of his beloved ones. Despite several inappropriate or sometimes immoral actions performed by Viktor, such as his reckless ambition in creating the creature and his subsequent abandonment, these flaws are often juxtaposed with his earlier noble aspirations and profound suffering. His initial drive, though misguided, stemmed from a desire to overcome death and contribute to humanity. This duality \u2013 the brilliant, grief-stricken student who becomes a neglectful, obsessive creator \u2013 prevents him from being a purely villainous figure. Instead, Victor embodies the tragic hero, whose immense intellect is overshadowed by emotional vulnerabilities and a profound lack of foresight. This complex blend of hubris and humanity allows readers to simultaneously condemn his choices and empathize with the profound isolation and despair that ultimately consume him, making his character deeply resonant.",
        "While the situation with the COVID-19 pandemic is critical, the case with mandatory vaccination at work is controversial. I think it is justified because it helps stop the pandemic; those unwilling to vaccinate should be ensured that they will not facilitate the contamination by the coronavirus. However, such a decision requires additional measures to ensure that the vaccine is safe and beneficial for the human organism. Despite a lack of time, as the pandemic must be conquered as soon as possible, the laws which require massive mandatory vaccination, under a threat of high fines, are the radical measure.\n\nImplementing such mandates fosters safer working environments, protecting vaccinated individuals and vulnerable colleagues. For the unvaccinated, stringent measures like frequent testing, enhanced PPE, and remote work are crucial to mitigate transmission risks. This balances individual choice with collective health, preventing workplaces from becoming viral epicenters. The goal is to safeguard public health while acknowledging personal liberties.\n\nHowever, radical fines risk eroding public trust and deepening divisions. Governments and employers must prioritize transparent communication on vaccine efficacy and safety. Before punitive actions, emphasis should be on educational campaigns, accessible programs, and incentives. An effective strategy balances urgency with ethics, achieving public health goals through informed consent and broad societal buy-in, not just coercion.",
        "It should be noted that there is a multitude of motivational factors to consider for a manager from both personal and organizational standpoints. In the case of the former, these include personal investment, personal growth, recognition, and achievement. On the organizational level, equity plays a critical role in impacting motivation since if there is a perception of inequity, then the disadvantaged workers will lose motivation. Dan Pink claims that there are also critically important and effective intrinsic motivators, such as autonomy, mastery, and purpose (TED, 2009). In addition, there are extrinsic motivational factors, such as competitive salaries, performance-based bonuses, and comprehensive benefits packages.\n\nThese tangible rewards provide a crucial foundation, addressing an individual's basic needs and offering a sense of security and validation for their efforts. While Pink emphasizes intrinsic drives, a manager\u2019s motivation often hinges on a blend of both types. For instance, a manager might seek the mastery of a new skill (intrinsic) but also expect a promotion and salary increase upon achieving it (extrinsic). Without adequate extrinsic compensation, even the most purpose-driven individual might eventually feel undervalued, leading to dissatisfaction and potential disengagement. Therefore, effective organizational strategies must thoughtfully combine opportunities for personal growth and autonomy with fair and competitive extrinsic rewards to foster a truly motivated and productive workforce.",
        "The choice of ship is connected with the running costs of transportation. Stopford (2009) claims that the best way to reduce costs is to select newer ships, which require fewer crewmembers, less maintenance, and are more reliable. While all of these points are true, they do not automatically make newer ships the preferable choice for shipping costs. As it stands, 65% of all cargo ships in the world are over 14 years old, meaning that competition for newer ships is intense (Cheng, 2021). High demand means increased costs, which was demonstrated by the increase in cargo rates in **the post-pandemic surge, where newbuild availability struggled to meet demand.** This scarcity drives up charter rates and purchase prices for modern vessels, often negating the operational savings touted by proponents of newer fleets. While older ships might incur higher maintenance expenses and potentially greater fuel consumption, their significantly lower acquisition cost\u2014often having been fully depreciated\u2014can present a compelling economic argument. For many operators, the reduced upfront capital expenditure associated with an older vessel outweighs the marginal operational efficiencies of a brand-new one, especially in a fluctuating market. Therefore, the true cost-effectiveness of a ship lies not solely in its age, but in a holistic assessment balancing CAPEX, OPEX, market dynamics, and a company's specific financial strategy.",
        "Goals and objectives outline desired outcomes and, thus, are often used interchangeably. However, the effect, timeframe, and specificity of the two terms set them apart. Nickels et al. (2019) define goals as broad and long-term outcomes that an organization seeks, while objectives define the measurable, specific, and short-term strategies for attaining the identified goal. For example, the criminal justice system uses goals to task the police, correctional agencies, and the court with the strategy to execute, including deterrence, rehabilitation, retribution, restoration, and incapacitation. Therefore, while deterrence is a long-term goal for law enforcement, an objective might be to reduce the incidence of a specific crime by 15% within the next six months through targeted patrols in high-crime areas. Similarly, for the goal of rehabilitation, a correctional facility might set an objective to enroll 75% of eligible inmates in vocational training programs by year-end, aiming to improve post-release employment rates. These objectives provide the concrete, actionable steps and measurable benchmarks against which progress towards the broader, more abstract goals can be evaluated. They transform aspirational aims into achievable targets, guiding operational planning and resource allocation. Without clearly defined objectives, goals remain mere ambitions, lacking the detailed roadmap necessary for successful implementation and accountability across the complex facets of the criminal justice system.",
        "Environment-friendly technologies develop with the growing social awareness about the issues caused by pesticides utilization in various industries. Sharma et al. (2020) claim that \u201cthese chemicals enter the ecosystem, thus hampering the sensitive environmental equilibrium through bio-accumulation\u201d (p. 110812). Consequently, alternative strategies become in demand for protecting the plants and species from biomagnification and severe changes in natural settings (Sharma et al., 2020). Biological, semi-chemical, and physical control methods for decreasing the use of pesticides require proper encouragement to achieve sustainable improvement in the ecological health and human well-being. These innovative approaches, ranging from introducing natural predators to using pheromones for pest disruption and employing physical barriers, offer promising pathways to agricultural and industrial sustainability. Unlike synthetic pesticides, they minimize harm to beneficial organisms, prevent chemical residues in food, and protect soil and water quality. Fostering their widespread adoption necessitates robust policies, increased research funding, and comprehensive educational outreach for stakeholders. Ultimately, a concerted global effort towards embracing these greener alternatives is crucial for safeguarding biodiversity, ensuring food security, and preserving the delicate balance of our planet for future generations. This shift represents a fundamental step towards true environmental stewardship.",
        "Motivation is the process whereby an individual's endeavors are stimulated, guided, and maintained toward achieving a goal. Thus, the responsibility of management is to monitor and direct workers in a company (Usmonovich, 2021). This is required since it is a method of inducing individuals to work, which they are capable and equipped to do freely. Even though most people have to work for a livelihood and a job is an essential part of everyone's lives, administrators must be apprehensive about employee motivation concerns for various reasons. Managers have several valid reasons to be concerned about motivating employees. Firstly, motivated employees exhibit higher productivity and efficiency, directly contributing to the company's bottom line. When individuals feel valued and driven, they invest more effort, leading to improved output. Secondly, strong motivation significantly reduces employee turnover. A workforce that feels engaged and appreciated is less likely to seek opportunities elsewhere, saving substantial costs associated with recruitment and training. This stability fosters a more experienced and cohesive team. Finally, motivated employees are more innovative and adaptable. They are willing to embrace new challenges, propose solutions, and collaborate effectively, which is crucial for organizational growth and navigating a dynamic market. Thus, investing in employee motivation is not merely a perk but a strategic imperative for sustained success.",
        "Feminist ethics is founded on the views that women's subordination is morally inappropriate and that women's moral experiences are as valuable as men's. Vaughn (2019) states that the following are the practical aims of feminist ethics. Firstly, feminist ethics express moral critiques of behaviors and attitudes that reinforce women's rights. Consequently, the vital goal is to provide morally reasonable means to oppose such behaviors and practices. Ultimately, feminist ethics' objective is to imagine a morally good alternative that promotes female empowerment. Feminist ethical argument resurfaced in the late 1960s, first among the general public and then in **academic and philosophical discourse. This intellectual movement challenged traditional, often male-centric, ethical theories for their perceived biases and omissions regarding women's experiences. It highlighted how historical ethical thought frequently universalized male perspectives, neglecting the specific moral dilemmas faced by women due to patriarchal structures. By emphasizing concepts like the ethics of care, relational autonomy, and intersectionality, feminist ethics seeks to reframe moral reasoning to be more inclusive and responsive to diverse human experiences. Its ongoing mission is to not only expose injustice but also to actively construct a more equitable and compassionate world for everyone.**",
        "The concept of culture is a fundamental phenomenon influencing all spheres of human life. It influences people's actions, methods, and approaches toward specific tasks and daily interactions. Thus, Roseberry determines culture as a socially constructed and socially constitutive part of the context where all activities take place. It means that all other fundamental institutions and phenomena, such as power, economy, and history, comprise the culture. At the same time, being the way of life, it influences the mentioned spheres and preconditions for the emergence of critical processes in these domains. In other words, peculiarities of culture influence how power is exercised and perceived, shaping governance structures, social hierarchies, and even the very definition of justice within a society. Economically, cultural values underpin consumption patterns, work ethics, innovation, and trade relations, dictating what is valued and how resources are allocated. Historically, culture acts as a filter through which events are interpreted and remembered, influencing collective memory, national identity, and future aspirations. This intricate relationship means that understanding a society's culture is paramount to comprehending its political evolution, economic development, and historical narrative. It is not merely a backdrop but an active, dynamic force that continuously shapes and is shaped by the human experience, making its study indispensable for navigating our complex world.",
        "In the modern world, diverse communities exist that support families in situations of emergency or need. Such support should be granted as sometimes families cannot manage their problems alone. Many communities provide families with support in diverse areas such as foster care, early childhood care, education, and homeless services (Fuss et al., 2021). For example, during the pandemics of COVID-19 many families experienced financial problems due to the ubiquitous job loss. Many such families could not cover their medical costs or even afford to buy normal food. Several organizations help families by caring about their young children or teenagers, offering vital resources like free tutoring, mental health counseling, and even nutritious meal programs when schools are closed. These initiatives extend beyond immediate relief, aiming to mitigate the long-term educational and psychological impacts of hardship on the youth. Furthermore, community-based support systems, whether formal charities or informal neighborhood networks, foster a sense of collective responsibility, ensuring that no family is left to navigate overwhelming challenges in isolation. This communal safety net is not merely an act of charity but a crucial investment in social stability and the well-being of future generations. Recognizing and bolstering these support structures is essential for building resilient communities capable of weathering future crises and ensuring equitable opportunities for all.",
        "Social media has become an integral part of the modern world, considering that many people opt to use these platforms to interact with others. Personally, I prefer to use Facebook as it is not flooded with spam and advertisement as much as Instagram, Tik Tok, or similar apps. I use Facebook to interact with my old friends, who I can no longer see because they moved to other cities or even countries, so this social platform seems a perfect option to interact with them from time to time. However, mainstream social media applications appear to have influenced today's society since people are constantly exposed to hate, cyberbullying, and misinformation.\n\nThe curated, often unrealistic, portrayal of lives on platforms like Instagram can foster feelings of inadequacy and anxiety among users, leading to a pervasive comparison culture. This constant exposure to seemingly perfect existences, coupled with the relentless pursuit of likes and validation, can profoundly impact self-esteem, particularly for younger demographics. Moreover, the algorithmic nature of many platforms tends to create echo chambers, reinforcing existing beliefs and limiting exposure to diverse perspectives, which in turn contributes to societal polarization. Users often find themselves in bubbles where dissenting opinions are rare, hindering constructive dialogue and understanding. While these platforms offer undeniable benefits for connection, the darker undercurrents of their influence on mental well-being, critical thinking, and social cohesion demand careful consideration and a more discerning approach to their use.",
        "The airline industry has been hit particularly hard by Covid 19. The virus outbreak has caused the governments of most countries to implement restrictions on traveling (Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aviation, 2022). Thus, the regulatory implementations have negatively affected the standard revenue, business practices, and practices of airline companies. First, passengers were less keen to travel due to the testing regulations, limited resources, and the lack of need to travel for work. Another cause was the regulation themselves that implied a reduction in Covid-19 cases through quarantine measures. The low demand has caused the airline industry to face unprecedented financial losses, leading to widespread grounding of fleets, significant reductions in flight schedules, and massive layoffs or furloughs for employees across the globe.\n\nAirlines struggled with liquidity crises as revenue plummeted, forcing many to seek government bailouts or loans to avoid bankruptcy. Beyond immediate financial woes, operational complexities surged, including the costly maintenance of idle aircraft and the challenge of re-certifying pilots and cabin crew for eventual return to service. The pandemic also accelerated a shift towards more flexible booking policies and enhanced health protocols, fundamentally altering the passenger experience. While recovery is underway, the long-term impacts, such as a potential permanent reduction in business travel and increased reliance on cargo operations, continue to reshape the industry's future landscape, demanding adaptability and innovation.",
        "There are multiple factors that stand behind the successful implementation of the P-O-L-C framework. It is important to prioritize some of them duly in case a company faces serious issues, or when the market indicates upcoming challenges. The collapse of WorldCom in 2002, that led to one of the largest accounting scandals in the US, provides a nice example of the lack of proper communication in a corporation. The inability of various top managers and accountants to communicate efficiently in order to prevent frauds is always disastrous. WorldCom grew rapidly under Bernard Ebbers who managed to jump at the multiple **acquisition opportunities, creating a complex structure where transparency became secondary. The immense pressure to meet earning targets, combined with a culture that stifled dissent, severely undermined ethical communication and internal controls. This breakdown, particularly within the 'Leading' and 'Controlling' functions of P-O-L-C, allowed fraudulent accounting entries to persist unchecked. Had open dialogue and accountability been prioritized, and had concerns been communicated effectively across all levels, the catastrophic fraud might have been prevented. WorldCom starkly illustrates that transparent, honest communication is not merely beneficial, but absolutely fundamental for organizational integrity and resilience, especially when navigating challenges.**",
        "Bandung Conference was the first encounter between Asian and African countries that had gained independence from the western colonies. President of Indonesia Suharto invited the leaders from developing countries to Bandung, leading to a declaration on anti-imperialism and peaceful coexistence. It was hoped to unite emerging nations through collaboration in reducing their reliance on Europe and America. The conference aimed to promote Afro-Asian economic cultural cooperation and reject neocolonialism. The fundamental principles of the meeting were to respect territorial integrity and sovereignty, refrain from the use of power, have peaceful ways of settling disputes, and promote mutual interests and cooperation. These foundational tenets, known as the Dasa Sila, also emphasized non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations, respect for fundamental human rights, and the equality of all races and nations. It firmly rejected the formation of military blocs that could serve the interests of great powers, advocating instead for collective self-defense in line with the UN Charter.\n\nThe Bandung Conference was a pivotal moment, signaling the rise of a 'Third World' voice on the global stage, distinct from both the capitalist West and the communist East. Though it did not lead to a formal organization, its principles laid the groundwork for the Non-Aligned Movement, which emerged a few years later. It fostered a spirit of solidarity among newly independent nations, giving them a platform to collectively address decolonization, economic development, and international peace, shaping the geopolitical landscape for decades to come.",
        "The first half of Imitation of Life deals with the question from a feminist perspective of what it means to be a woman living in a male-dominated society, while the second half deals with how women of color are affected by racism. Heung notes that it is a story about imitation and pretending to be untrue. Lora Meredith, a white woman, widow, and aspiring actress, always pretends. The motive for this behavior is to avoid the hassle of raising his only daughter, Susie, alone with very little money. Although Lora defies stereotypes by not letting any man control her life or career, her relentless pursuit of stardom creates a different kind of performance. This constant pretense, a form of self-preservation in a cutthroat industry, ironically mirrors Heung's observation about \"imitation.\" Lora, in her striving for independence, adopts a persona that distances her from genuine emotional engagement, particularly with Susie. Her seemingly empowered choices inadvertently reflect the societal pressures on women to choose between family and career, or to adopt a masculine drive for success. The film powerfully contrasts Lora\u2019s gender-based struggles with Annie Johnson\u2019s and Sarah Jane\u2019s racialized experiences, where the act of \"pretending\" becomes a desperate bid for acceptance and survival in a fundamentally unjust world, magnifying the painful costs of assimilation.",
        "It is important to note that the decision-making process is a complex and highly intricate activity, which involves the accuracy of the information, a clear vision of objectives, and an understanding of the underlying issues. Errors in the decision-making process are common and can be done by any manager. However, there is a clear distinction between a bad decision and a wrong decision. In the case of the latter, the decision is the result of reliance on false or inaccurate information with the best intentions to make a correct choice. When it comes to a bad decision, a manager is aware of and has disregarded critical information, overlooked clear warning signs, or consciously chosen a suboptimal path. This type of decision often stems from a lack of ethical grounding, a pursuit of personal gain, or sheer negligence despite possessing accurate data. Unlike a wrong decision, which is an honest misstep rooted in misinformation, a bad decision reflects a deliberate or careless failure of judgment. The implications for accountability differ significantly. A wrong decision can be attributed to process flaws, prompting system improvements. Conversely, a bad decision points to a fundamental flaw in the manager's character, competence, or commitment. Understanding this distinction is crucial for fostering genuine learning and ensuring appropriate consequences within an organization.",
        "The process of forming states is not characterized by ease. It involves many different processes, including cultural strategies of strength. It is believed that this aspect in the form of actions of social agents is of particular importance. This is because they occupy a central place in such processes as the formation of alliances and the establishment of dominance relations. Understanding this concept can give a better understanding of the creation of Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India. First, it is necessary to understand what a social strategy of power is and what significance it has. Thus, it is defined as a particular area where individuals or groups deliberately employ diverse methods to acquire, maintain, or exert influence and control over others and resources. This encompasses both overt actions, like military force or economic coercion, and subtle ones, such as ideological persuasion, religious legitimation, or the manipulation of social networks. Its significance lies in being the fundamental driver behind the formation of power structures, the forging of alliances, and the establishment of dominance. For instance, in Western Europe, feudal lords strategically used land and loyalty; in China, imperial elites wielded bureaucracy and the Mandate of Heaven. The Islamic World\u2019s expansion was driven by religious authority and military might, while India's states arose from complex interplays of social and political maneuvering. These agent-driven strategies are the very engines of state evolution.",
        "Culture is the entirety of social norms, behaviors, and customs which distinguish a certain society from the rest of the world. Naturally, some cultures have common features, thus forming cultural clusters. At the same time, leadership is a personality trait that transcends national boundaries. This does not imply that all people with power behave in the same manner, as leaders are also influenced by cultural norms. Behavior differences are evident in the way people in different clusters view time. Middle Eastern cultures are frequently juxtaposed to Western ones, particularly American. Beehner writes that while \u201cmost Middle Eastern nations operate on a polychronic time system, prioritizing relationships and flexibility over strict schedules, Western cultures, particularly American, adhere to a monochronic view, valuing punctuality and linear progression.\u201d This fundamental difference profoundly impacts leadership styles and daily interactions. In polychronic societies, a meeting might be interrupted or delayed by an emergent personal issue, and multiple tasks are often managed concurrently. Leaders here must exhibit patience and adaptability, as rigid adherence to timetables can be seen as dismissive. Conversely, Western leaders, expecting precise scheduling and directness, may view such flexibility as inefficiency. Recognizing these distinct cultural lenses on time is paramount for effective cross-cultural leadership, enabling mutual understanding and successful global collaboration.",
        "The suggested strategies to mitigate the effects of coronavirus in accordance with the example of Iceland could be considered as an interesting approach. This strategy acknowledges its apparent limitations, such as the resilience of the Iceland community, geographical idiosyncrasy. However, currently, this strategy might not be a valid method to address the high margins of infected individuals in NATO countries. It is certainly true that quick response and high testing rates would contribute to the deterrence of the effects imposed by the sudden growth of the number of infected. However, it is similarly meaningful that the population would be willing to undergo such a measure. Iceland's success hinged on its ability to rapidly implement widespread testing, contact tracing, and isolation, facilitated by a small, trusting populace and manageable borders.\n\nFor larger, more interconnected nations like those in NATO, replicating this scale of intervention presents immense logistical and societal hurdles. The sheer volume of people, diverse economic activities, and extensive international travel make comprehensive and immediate testing a monumental undertaking. Furthermore, public willingness to comply with strict isolation and tracing measures is not automatic; it relies heavily on clear governmental communication, trust in public health institutions, and a shared understanding of collective responsibility. Without these foundational elements, even the most scientifically sound strategies risk significant public resistance, ultimately compromising their effectiveness in a large-scale pandemic response.",
        "The rapidly changing situation in the market of goods and services forces organizations to adapt efficiently and quickly. It results in overly rapid changes within the enterprise without a smooth transition. The fast pace is becoming a problem for both the company and employees. Team members are forced to quickly adapt to new work formats, promptly learn new skills, and take on additional roles. In such conditions, competent and high-quality change management and decision-making are essential. In an age of global transformation, change management has become one of the principal success factors for most companies. The surrounding reality is in a state of constant flux. This perpetual evolution means that what constituted a competitive edge yesterday might be an outdated liability tomorrow, compelling organizations to continuously re-evaluate their strategies, processes, and even core competencies. For the workforce, this translates into a demanding environment where job security can feel precarious, and burnout becomes a significant risk due to the relentless need for reskilling and role diversification. Effective change management, therefore, transcends mere procedural updates; it's about empathetically guiding individuals through the emotional and practical challenges of transition. It necessitates clear communication, comprehensive training, robust support systems, and the cultivation of an organizational culture that embraces resilience and continuous learning. Without such robust frameworks, companies risk internal chaos, plummeting morale, and ultimately, a failure to keep pace with the external environment. Mastering this art of controlled adaptation is thus paramount for sustained growth and survival in the modern era.",
        "The two American regions to be first settled by the English colonists were New England and the Chesapeake Bay. In the Chesapeake Bay, the colonists arrived under the auspices of Virginia Company \u2013 a joint-stock enterprise dedicated to colonizing America for profit. Although the early hopes of finding precious metals did not materialize, the region eventually found its economic specialization in growing tobacco (Corbett et al., 2022). The company hired the English poor for the labor-intensive task of growing the colony and producing tobacco, and most of the newcomers were young single males (Corbett et al., 2022). This demographic, combined with high mortality rates, resulted in a transient, male-dominated society, initially using indentured servitude then shifting to enslaved African labor for tobacco production.\n\nIn contrast, New England was settled by Puritan families seeking religious freedom, not profit. Their aim was to build a \"city upon a hill,\" a morally upright community. This fostered a balanced demographic, including women and children, leading to stable towns and a focus on communal welfare. Economically, New England diversified into subsistence farming, fishing, and shipbuilding, avoiding reliance on a single cash crop. These fundamental differences in purpose, demographics, and economic strategies profoundly shaped the distinct development paths of these two pivotal colonial regions.",
        "The secret of IKEA's success on the global market lies in its perfect execution of all components of the marketing mix. The company has adapted its strategy to each market with precision, flexibility, and creativity that made its products highly recognized. The ingenuity of its marketing mix proposal can serve as an example for other companies in Europe and worldwide. In this paper, the four components of IKEA's marketing mix will be discussed. This Swedish company has gained renown for the quality, accessibility, and innovativeness of its products. First of all, the firm's pricing strategy is focused on offering affordable home furnishing solutions. This is achieved through economies of scale, efficient flat-pack logistics, and customer self-assembly, which transfers labor costs, ensuring competitive prices accessible to a broad demographic.\n\nSecondly, IKEA's product strategy centers on 'democratic design,' blending form, function, quality, and sustainability with affordability. Their distinctive modern designs appeal globally, offering a vast range from essentials to complete solutions, all designed for simple DIY assembly.\n\nThirdly, IKEA's distribution (place) strategy utilizes large, out-of-town stores, meticulously designed to create an immersive showroom experience. Customers navigate curated displays before proceeding to the self-service warehouse. This unique layout encourages exploration and efficient pick-up, reinforcing the brand\u2019s value proposition.\n\nFinally, IKEA's promotion extends beyond traditional advertising. While its iconic catalog (now digital) showcases products, the in-store experience itself serves as a powerful promotional tool. Clear branding, lifestyle imaging, and a consistent message of affordable, functional, and stylish living are communicated through every touchpoint, building a strong global brand identity.",
        "\u201cFences\u201d by American playwright August Wilson was published in 1987. This play is about an elderly scavenger Troy, a basketball star in his youth. It is worth mentioning that \u201cFences\u201d contains many essential topics for discussion which are relevant nowadays. For instance, the first scene reveals the duties and responsibilities of fathers and sons. There are many interpretations of \u201cFences,\u201d including staged and filmed versions, and it is important to discuss both to understand their features. The spectator sees James Earl Jones in the role of a strict father. His powerful portrayal captures Troy\u2019s complex nature: a man burdened by racial discrimination, failed dreams, and a deeply flawed understanding of love and protection. Jones masterfully conveys Troy's rigid adherence to what he believes is right, even as it alienates him from his son, Cory, who seeks to pursue his own athletic aspirations. This central conflict, a generational clash between a father\u2019s jaded pragmatism and a son\u2019s burgeoning hope, forms the emotional core of the play. While the stage production emphasizes the raw, intimate power of the spoken word and the symbolic nature of the fence itself, the film adaptation, directed by and starring Denzel Washington, offers a more expansive visual context, grounding the characters in their Pittsburgh environment. Both versions, however, succeed in illuminating the profound struggles of African American families in the mid-20th century, exploring themes of legacy, betrayal, and the enduring search for dignity.",
        "Levels of culture can be displayed in different planes and depths. According to Edgar Shein, who developed the concept \u2018levels of organizational culture,' and Edward Granter who later expanded on this concept, the culture of the entity can be seen in four levels: super-structural, symbolic, discursive, and cognitive (Granter, 2019). In other words, the levels of culture in enterprises are developed due to external economic and social influences, artifacts such as logos, story rituals and events, values explicitly expressed by the organization, and underlying assumptions. This paper aims to assess the practical utility of this multi-layered framework for diagnosing and transforming organizational culture. Understanding these levels allows leaders to move beyond superficial observations (super-structural and symbolic) to grasp the deeper, often unstated, drivers of behavior (discursive and cognitive). For instance, a company struggling with innovation might have a symbolic artifact (a \"think outside the box\" poster) and discursive values (openness), yet its cognitive level could harbor deeply ingrained assumptions about risk aversion or hierarchical decision-making that stifle true creativity. Recognizing this disconnect enables targeted interventions. By analyzing how external pressures shape the super-structure, how artifacts reinforce or contradict explicit values, and how these values manifest from underlying assumptions, organizations can develop more holistic strategies for cultural alignment and change, fostering environments where stated goals are truly supported by ingrained beliefs and practices.",
        "The article highlighted multiple reasons why women chose to be child-free. These include the desire to succeed from an academic and professional perspective, financial reasons, a lack of natural desires, and the understanding that a child would not enhance their life but rather make it more difficult (Sandler). There were a couple of things that I can't entirely agree with. The choice of a woman to be in a serious relationship with a man with a 15-year-old daughter without taking even minimal parental responsibilities appears to be inconsiderate for the young girl both from the perspective of the childfree woman *herself and the father*.\n\nWhile a woman has every right to choose a child-free life, entering a committed relationship with someone who already has dependents introduces a different dynamic. To intentionally avoid any engagement with a partner's existing child, even a teenager, seems to contradict the very essence of a \"serious relationship.\" It risks creating an unstable environment for the young person, who might interpret such detachment as indifference or even rejection. A genuine partnership, in my view, necessitates a degree of empathy and willingness to acknowledge, if not actively participate in, all significant aspects of a partner's life. This isn't about abandoning one's child-free stance, but about demonstrating respect and consideration for the family unit one chooses to join.",
        "The devastation and challenges of World War II were tremendous. The U.S. faced severe and significant objectives that would define the future state of America and European countries. It was essential for the U.S. to oppose Communist expansion in Europe and Asia, so there were specific policies that addressed this aim, and evaluating their efficiency and success may provide valuable insights. First, it is essential to discuss the policy of containment that was adopted by America and its allies. The purpose of this strategy was to prevent the spread of communism and respond to the Soviet Union's moves to expand its influence in a **post-war world.** This policy, articulated in the Truman Doctrine, aimed to bolster democratic governments and economies, making them less susceptible to Soviet ideological infiltration. The Marshall Plan, for instance, provided massive economic aid to Western Europe, successfully rebuilding infrastructure and fostering stability, thereby creating a strong bulwark against communism. Similarly, NATO's formation established a collective security alliance against Soviet aggression. While containment successfully prevented direct Soviet military expansion into Western Europe, its application in Asia, particularly in Vietnam and Korea, proved more complex and costly, leading to prolonged conflicts and mixed results. Its overall efficacy thus presents a nuanced picture, marked by both strategic successes and controversial, often tragic, consequences that profoundly shaped global geopolitics.",
        "Melanoma is generally recognized as one of the cancers that have an increasing cover percentage, though it is usually diagnosed at early stages. Recently, the ways of melanoma treatment for patients with metastatic disease were so limited that many patients were practically doomed. Fortunately, melanoma therapeutics have developed for the past decade because of the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Now, people with stages II and III may easily have a long period of remission. Therefore, modern options for melanoma treatment serve as a source of hope for numerous people. Indeed, innovations in the sphere of melanoma treatment are a profound testament to scientific dedication and the power of immunological understanding. The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors, specifically, has dramatically reshaped the landscape for patients, particularly those with advanced or metastatic disease. Where a diagnosis once carried a near-certain grim prognosis, these therapies now offer the genuine possibility of durable remission and even long-term survival. By unleashing the body's own immune system to target cancer cells, they have transformed what was once a death sentence into a manageable, and often treatable, condition. This monumental shift not only extends lives but also significantly improves the quality of life for countless individuals, fostering optimism and paving the way for further breakthroughs in oncology. The future, once bleak, now shines with promise for melanoma patients.",
        "Considerable musicians have represented soul music, and James Brown was one of the most prominent. Southern soul became extremely popular towards the end of the 1960s, and Brown had his first success in 1956 (Covach and Flory 218). Initially, Brown worked as a stand-in for Little Richard, and his first record, \u201cPlease Please Please,\u201d was quite thriving (Covach and Flory 240-241). Brown used to sing lead vocals, and his early musical style resembled that of the 1950s doo-wop (Covach and Flory 241). However, Brown quickly transcended these early influences, pioneering a new sound that would become known as funk. His innovative approach shifted the focus from melodic harmony to rhythmic precision, emphasizing the \"one\" beat and creating intricate, interlocking grooves (Covach and Flory 245). This revolutionary rhythmic foundation, coupled with his raw, impassioned vocals and dynamic stage presence, distinguished him as a singular force in music.\n\nBrown\u2019s live performances were legendary, characterized by his energetic dance moves, charismatic interactions with his band, and his iconic cape routine. Songs like \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\" and \"Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\" exemplify his mature sound, showcasing tight horn arrangements, minimalist yet powerful instrumentation, and his signature grunts and shouts (Covach and Flory 248). His influence extended far beyond soul, deeply impacting the development of funk, hip-hop, and various forms of dance music. James Brown\u2019s relentless pursuit of rhythmic innovation and his unparalleled showmanship cemented his legacy as the \"Godfather of Soul,\" a title he truly earned through a career of groundbreaking artistry.",
        "In the history of mankind, the computer has become one of the most important inventions. Hardly anyone can imagine a modern home or office without computers. While some people argue that the computer has provided us with additional conveniences, according to others, the computer has made our life more complex and stressful. I believe that computers, in the first place, have enriched our society with several advantages due to faster communication and easier access to information. The computer provides us with a fast way to communicate. In our time, when modern society is becoming more global, computers play an essential role in communication. Whether through instant messaging, email, or video conferencing, geographical barriers have dissolved, allowing families to stay connected, businesses to operate globally, and collaborations to flourish across continents. This immediate exchange of ideas and information fosters a more interconnected and understanding world.\n\nFurthermore, the computer, coupled with the internet, has democratized knowledge. From academic research to practical how-to guides, an unprecedented amount of information is now available at our fingertips. This ease of access empowers individuals to learn new skills, conduct research, and make informed decisions, significantly enhancing education and personal development. While undoubtedly presenting new challenges, the transformative power of computers in enhancing communication and information accessibility far outweighs the complexities, making them indispensable tools for progress and societal advancement.",

        "It goes without saying that Beowulf may be regarded as one of the most prominent ancient European poems. Although its origin remains the subject of multiple discussions, the common version describes it as \u201ca Danish poem in the Anglo-Saxon dialect\u201d (Neidorf 847). The poem describes the glorious life and deeds of a hero, Beowulf, who was regarded as a person sent by heaven for people (Gummere line 13). Helping Hrothgar, king of the Danes, he kills the monster Grendel and his mother. Later, when his service to the Danes was complete, Beowulf returned to his homeland, Geatland, where he eventually ascended to the throne, ruling as a wise and just king for fifty prosperous years.\n\nHis long reign, however, was tragically interrupted by the awakening of a fearsome dragon, enraged by the theft of a golden cup from its hoard. Despite his advanced age, Beowulf, ever the protector, chose to face the beast alone to safeguard his people. In a final, climactic battle, he successfully slays the dragon but sustains a mortal wound. His death, while a somber end, solidifies his legacy as the ultimate hero, embodying the Anglo-Saxon ideals of courage, loyalty, and self-sacrifice. The poem, therefore, transcends a simple narrative, offering profound insights into ancient values and the enduring human struggle against chaos and evil.",
        "The reason for the military conflict between the United States and Spain was the American government's support for the Cubans' long battle for independence from the Spanish crown. The US invasion of Cuba became evident when the USS \u201cMaine\u201d sank under mysterious conditions in the waters of Havana. Around the same time, in February 1898, hasty preparations for war began, while the Spaniards were accused in absentia of undermining the battleship (Mortenson & Springer, 2019). In general, one can talk about a long-term political game with Spain, in which several provocations, largely fueled by sensationalist \"yellow journalism,\" contributed to the escalating tensions. Newspapers like William Randolph Hearst\u2019s *New York Journal* and Joseph Pulitzer\u2019s *New York World* capitalized on public outrage over alleged Spanish atrocities in Cuba, often exaggerating or fabricating stories to sell copies and push for intervention. This media-driven frenzy cultivated a jingoistic atmosphere, making war with Spain increasingly popular among the American public. Beyond humanitarian concerns, significant economic interests in Cuba, particularly sugar plantations, and a broader ambition for regional hegemony in the Caribbean also underpinned U.S. policy. The sinking of the *Maine*, regardless of its true cause\u2014later attributed to an internal explosion\u2014served as the ultimate catalyst, providing the administration with the popular mandate it needed to declare war and expand its influence, marking a pivotal moment in American foreign policy and imperial aspirations.",
        "This paper will provide an analysis of the article \u201cCOVID-19: Impact on Nurses and Nursing\u201d by Fauteux (2021). The abstract is supposed to be the opening of the article. It is a way to quickly introduce the reader to the results of the research. In this article, the abstract is a brief overview of the topic that will be discussed. However, it contains no information about the methods of the research or its results. On this basis, such an abstract cannot be called comprehensive. The article's introduction is already more extensive, offering a general overview of the pandemic\u2019s global impact before narrowing its focus to the specific challenges faced by nurses. It effectively sets the stage by highlighting the unprecedented demands placed on healthcare systems and personnel.\n\nHowever, similar to the abstract, the introduction still falls short of clearly outlining the research methodology employed, making it difficult for the reader to understand the basis of the subsequent discussion. A crucial element missing throughout the initial sections is a transparent description of how the information was gathered, whether through literature review, qualitative studies, or quantitative data analysis. While the article delves into various aspects of the nursing experience during COVID-19, such as burnout, moral distress, and the need for support, the absence of a defined methodological framework weakens the credibility of its claims. A comprehensive academic article typically details its approach to data collection and analysis, allowing for critical evaluation of its findings. Without this, the reader is left to assume the nature of the evidence presented, which diminishes the article\u2019s overall scholarly rigor and impact.",
        "The issue of tribal sovereignty has been scrutinized over the years, the treatment of tribes ranging from supportive measures and attempts of integration into the broader community to outright persecution. In this connection, the law about tribal gaming can be seen as a positive step towards recognition of tribes' unique way of life and self-determination. This essay discusses the question \u201chow tribal gaming act can add to the sovereignty of tribes?\u201d Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes were given the right to determine what gaming activities they wanted to engage in, and in most cases, the permission was granted by the **states, through negotiated compacts.** This legislative framework, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) of 1988, fundamentally bolstered tribal sovereignty by providing a critical pathway to economic self-sufficiency. Gaming revenues, managed by the tribes, have transformed communities, enabling direct investments in essential services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. This financial independence reduces reliance on federal funding, empowering tribes to exercise greater self-determination. Furthermore, IGRA explicitly recognizes tribal governments' inherent authority to regulate gaming on their lands, reinforcing their governmental powers and jurisdiction. This ability to control their economic future and manage significant enterprises directly affirms tribal self-rule and their distinct status as sovereign nations.",
        "Developing a contract so that all parties involved could be aware of their obligations and meet them accordingly is one of the vital tasks for an organization. Charles Schwab, an organization offering banking and brokerage services, has developed a contract for its users to sign so that both parties could meet the respective requirements (Reder et al., 2021). For their collaboration. Since the contract in question contains the essential components of a legal agreement, it can be considered viable. Starting with the key definitions of the foundational concepts on which the agreement is based, Schwab's contract establishes the offer, acceptance, and **consideration necessary for a binding agreement.** It clearly outlines the services provided by Schwab (the offer) and the user's agreement to the terms and conditions upon account creation (acceptance). Furthermore, the contract specifies the financial obligations and reciprocal benefits for both parties, constituting the essential consideration. Beyond these core elements, the document also addresses the legal capacity of the parties, ensuring that both Schwab and the user are legally capable of entering into such an agreement. This comprehensive approach minimizes ambiguity and potential disputes. By clearly articulating each party's rights, responsibilities, and the consequences of non-compliance, Schwab\u2019s contract serves as a robust framework. It fosters trust and accountability, ensuring that users understand their commitments and Schwab can deliver its services efficiently, thereby upholding the integrity of their collaborative relationship and mitigating risks for all involved.",
        "The study showed that bibliometric analysis of evidence gathered from integrative reviews and analytical studies had substantial implications for nurse-related and evidence based policy changes. Primarily, this is possible through the use of integrative reviews in designing new programs (Benton et al., 2020). The collective database of the synthesized studies as suggested by the authors of the study, can be utilized by nurses to be empowered through evidence-based materials in the formulation of changes in universal health coverage. As such, the applicability of this information has a number of benefits for working nurses, as they will be better equipped to make informed clinical decisions at the bedside. This evidence-based approach fosters greater confidence and autonomy, empowering them to challenge outdated practices and champion innovative solutions. Furthermore, access to synthesized research allows nurses to actively participate in policy discussions, advocating for patient-centered care and more equitable healthcare systems. Their insights, grounded in robust data, become invaluable in shaping universal health coverage initiatives, ensuring policies are practical, effective, and responsive to real-world needs. This empowers nurses not just as caregivers, but as crucial agents of systemic change, driving improvements in public health outcomes.",
        "There is no simple answer to what it means to be human. Some might say that being human means being independent and controlling their personal lives. For other people, being human means utilizing the refinements of civilization, wearing clothes, and going to work every day, i.e., doing everything that animals cannot do. It is also complicated to say how people want to live because everyone has unique requirements, dreams, and thoughts on this issue. This essay reflects on the On Being podcast and answers the above questions. In the podcast, Thich Nhat Hanh explains why people need to be *fully present and deeply connected to themselves and the world around them*.\n\nHe argues that the frantic pace of modern life often disconnects us from our authentic being, leading to suffering. For Hanh, the essence of being human lies not in external achievements or the mastery of our environment, but in our capacity for mindfulness, compassion, and interconnectedness. He suggests that true independence comes from liberation from mental noise, and genuine fulfillment arises from appreciating each moment. Thus, living well means cultivating inner peace, embracing our shared humanity, and recognizing the interdependence of all life. This perspective profoundly reshapes our understanding, moving beyond superficial definitions to a deeper, more spiritual appreciation of human existence.",
        "Unemployment is a significant social and economic problem. Not always positive aspects of enterprise development contribute to a decrease in the percentage of unemployed. The negative impact may be cumulative along with phenomena such as inflation external factors, including the pandemic. Difficulties in obtaining an education for low-income families only widen the gap between the rich and the poor, which in America is already the largest in the world (Telford, 2019). Consequently, the leading causes of unemployment are inflation, advanced technology, and lack of education or skills for employment. Inflation drives up prices in the economy. This erodes purchasing power, forcing businesses to cut costs, often through layoffs. Meanwhile, advanced technology, like automation, replaces human labor, demanding new skills. Without accessible education or retraining, many workers cannot adapt, creating a significant skill gap. This inability to meet evolving job market needs leaves a substantial portion of the workforce unemployable. Addressing these multifaceted challenges requires strategic investment in education and reskilling programs, alongside policies that stabilize the economy.",
        "Swimmer Lia Thomas attended the University of Pennsylvania as a student. In 2021, the media focused on her successes in sports as a trans woman. Lia Thomas, a first-time competitor in the women's division, had a strong showing. Early in December, she had her greatest college results of the year in Ohio, when she competed in the two hundred and five hundred meter sprints. After Lia Thomas' successes at university swimming pools, she was criticized following the fact that she was born a male, which gave him an advantage. Some people argued that because Thomas was taking testosterone therapy, her participation was unfair to cisgender female athletes. Critics highlighted that despite hormone therapy, inherent biological advantages from male puberty, such as bone density, lung capacity, and muscle mass, are not fully reversed. This sparked a contentious debate about fairness, inclusion, and the definition of 'woman' in sports. Supporters, however, emphasized her adherence to NCAA rules, which required a year of hormone therapy, and argued that excluding trans women undermines their identity and right to participate in the sport they love. The controversy brought to light the complex intersection of biological sex, gender identity, and competitive equity, leaving governing bodies grappling with how to establish policies that balance the interests of all athletes while upholding principles of fairness and inclusivity in women's sports.",
        "Outreach Chicago is an organization providing help and services to homeless people and those underserved by already existing incorporations. The company's main mission is to provide help and necessities to humans for their subsequent successful reintegration into society. To practice deductive reasoning, it is essential to start by formulating a general hypothesis or statement that Outreach Chicago provides help to people (Adler & Clark, 2015). The observation allows us to find evidence for the statement as Outreach Chicago serves meals and distributes hygiene kits, coats, blankets, socks, and undergarments to people in need. Since providing meals, essential hygiene products, and protective clothing directly addresses fundamental human needs, these specific actions serve as concrete instances of \"providing help.\" Therefore, through a deductive process, if Outreach Chicago engages in these observed activities, it logically follows that the initial general hypothesis \u2013 that Outreach Chicago provides help to people \u2013 is robustly supported. This systematic approach confirms the organization's adherence to its stated mission, demonstrating how specific evidence validates broader claims about its humanitarian efforts.",
        "The healthcare industry typically draws sufficient attention to patients' education, especially when it comes to representatives of minority groups. That is why the article by McCurley et al. (2017) offers valuable information. The researchers demonstrate that Hispanic individuals deal with improved diabetes prevention when they participate in individual and group face-to-face sessions (McCurley et al., 2017). I believe that there is an apparent reason why such positive outcomes are achieved. It seems that face-to-face interventions are effective because patients have an opportunity to ask questions if they require explanations. Simultaneously, such **direct interaction fosters a sense of trust and rapport between educators and patients. This personal connection is crucial, particularly for minority groups who may encounter cultural or linguistic barriers in healthcare settings. Immediate clarification of complex medical terms and personalized feedback ensures that information is not just passively received but actively understood and applied. Moreover, in group sessions, the face-to-face format cultivates a supportive community where individuals can share experiences and reinforce healthy behaviors. This interactive, human-centered approach moves beyond mere information dissemination, empowering patients to confidently navigate their health journey and make sustainable lifestyle changes, thereby significantly improving preventive health outcomes.**",
        "Since it is assumed that skiing is a rather traumatic sport, the company should have taken precautions for minimizing the injury risks for the skiers. However, in that particular case, the actions of the company's workers have created risks for health damage for Mr. Craig and Mr. Alex, who were actually injured. The fact that it was April and the slopes were supposed to be closed may lessen the degree of the company's responsibility in this particular case, but not completely. The company made a mistake letting people ski after the snowstorm though it could not have allowed people to do it. The company's primary obligation, given the inherent dangers of skiing, is to prioritize skier safety through meticulous slope maintenance, clear warnings, and appropriate closures. Their decision to permit skiing after a snowstorm, especially in April when conditions are notoriously variable, demonstrates a profound lapse in judgment and a disregard for established safety protocols. While patrons might assume some risk when engaging in extreme sports, this does not absolve the service provider from its duty to ensure a reasonably safe environment. The \"April\" argument, suggesting slopes *should* be closed, paradoxically strengthens the case against the company, highlighting their negligence in actively allowing access despite evident hazards. This constitutes a clear breach of their duty of care, directly contributing to the injuries sustained by Mr. Craig and Mr. Alex, and underscores the need for stringent accountability in recreational industries.",
        "Service marketing is usually defined as a promotion of an intangible good or a service to a particular segment of the audience. It is distinguished from product marketing by such features as Inseparability, Heterogeneity, Intangibility, and Perishability. This paper will focus on the last characteristic, perishability, which implies the impossibility of any storage or repeated use of the service. In case the service is not used, it is most likely to be lost forever (Hole et al., 2018). Examples of such can be a concert or a sports event. Sometimes they can be canceled either due to unforeseen circumstances or simply face unsold capacity. When a seat at a concert remains empty, or a flight departs with an unoccupied seat, the revenue opportunity for that specific instance is irretrievably lost. Unlike a physical product that can be inventoried and sold at a later date, a service unit, once its time slot passes, ceases to exist.\n\nThis inherent challenge forces service providers to adopt specific strategies to manage demand and capacity. Hotels, for instance, cannot \"store\" an empty room night; hence, they often employ dynamic pricing, offering last-minute deals or varying rates based on demand fluctuations. Similarly, consultants manage their time meticulously, as an unbilled hour is revenue forgone. The perishable nature of services necessitates robust forecasting and proactive demand management, often through reservation systems, flexible staffing, and price adjustments, to maximize utilization and minimize the significant financial losses associated with unused capacity. This makes managing supply and demand a critical balancing act for service marketers.",
        "Care ethics theory was thoroughly criticized based on the concept of slave morality. This idea was developed by Nietzsche and declares that discriminated people often create the mindset that enables them to treat their forced servant behavior as a kind of virtuous manners (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, n.d.). Thus, the urge and readiness to provide care are viewed not as a positive trait but lowliness that only strengthens oppression. The other criticism of care ethics lies in the notion that provided help is often parochial. Namely, the caregivers prefer their relatives, friends, and the citizens of their country over other people who may be in greater need but lack such personal ties. This selective approach challenges the notion of universal moral obligation, raising concerns about fairness and justice. Critics argue that while personal relationships are undoubtedly valuable, an ethical framework should ideally offer guidance for interactions beyond these intimate spheres, addressing the needs of a broader humanity. The absence of clear, impartial principles for widespread application limits its scope and effectiveness as a comprehensive moral theory, particularly in complex societal or global contexts where impartial judgment is crucial.",
        "Scott Kiesling focuses on the address term dude in the article Dude (2004), whereby the term's pattern of use, meanings, and functions are highlighted. The author is an American sociolinguist prompted to research dude's functions and implications in the American culture by his undying interests in gender and language. Dude portrays a specific pattern of use influenced by its societal functions and meanings, thus explaining its high usage and enhanced popularity. Dude is mostly used by the younger generation of European American men when addressing one another and partly by women. Kiesling (2004) reports that its primary function among young men is to express solidarity and maintain a casual, non-hierarchical relationship. He identifies six main functions: marking an in-group, expressing discourse newness, showing connection, disagreement, exclamation, and a form of address. For men, 'dude' often mediates potentially aggressive or competitive interactions, allowing for a relaxed camaraderie without overt emotional expression, aligning with masculine norms. While less frequent, women's use of 'dude' tends to mirror these solidarity-building functions, often signaling a relaxed, informal stance. Ultimately, Kiesling argues that 'dude' is a versatile discourse marker that encapsulates aspects of American youth culture, particularly its emphasis on coolness, casualness, and a particular form of masculine bonding.",
        "Aristotle made a discovery fundamental to all logic by introducing variables. Thus, it was shown that logic is not just a specific doctrine of specific things or terms, but the science of the laws of syllogisms, such as modus ponens or modus tollens, expressed in variables. Studying various judgments, formal logic abstracts from their specific content, revealing a structure common to objects of different content. Syllogism is the discovery of Aristotle and is the main and most original part of his logic. In the theory of syllogisms, Aristotle defined the fundamental components and valid forms of deductive reasoning. He categorized propositions by quantity and quality (A, E, I, O) and identified the major, minor, and middle terms within a syllogism. He then systematically analyzed how their arrangement across premises determines the syllogism\u2019s figure and cataloged various valid moods. This meticulous framework allowed for the assessment of logical necessity in conclusions. His groundbreaking work, primarily in *Prior Analytics*, established a formal system of inference that abstracted from specific content, thereby making logic a universal tool for evaluating argument structure. This enduring contribution cemented logic as a science, profoundly influencing Western thought for millennia and demonstrating the power of formal analysis beyond specific truths.",
        "The current global landscape of the agricultural economy is composed of large companies. In fact, their presence is prevalent enough to dictate and formulate policies and standards within the industry (Chemnitz et al., 2017). In practice, this has resulted in a number of discrepancies such as environmental damages, violations of human and labor rights, and even the lack of effort to minimize poverty. While the scale of the issue may seem too large to resolve, alterations of consumer buying habits have the potential to foster diversity within such industries. However, buying habits are only a small fragment of a number of interventions that are essential for systemic change. Robust governmental policies are crucial, including anti-trust legislation to curb monopolistic power and direct subsidies for small-scale and sustainable farming operations. Furthermore, advocating for stricter international regulations on labor and environmental standards, coupled with transparent supply chains, can hold large corporations accountable. Educational initiatives, informing both producers about eco-friendly methods and consumers about ethical choices, empower stakeholders. Ultimately, a multi-pronged approach combining legislative action, economic incentives, and increased public awareness is vital to dismantle the entrenched power of agricultural giants and cultivate a more equitable, diverse, and sustainable food system for all.",
        "\u201cInterpreter of Maladies\u201d introduces the reader to a collapsing world of a dysfunctional family. In the novel, Mr. Das sparks both sympathy and a sense of slight annoyance that is likely to transform into disdain after considering the evolution of his character. Although the character might seem benevolent and sympathetic at first, his evident inability to emotionally connect with his wife or children indicates the need for further evolution, which never occurs. At first glance, Mr. Das represents a character that is easy to empathize with and relate to due to his kind nature. Indeed, Mr. Das is a seemingly harmless figure, preoccupied with his camera and sightseeing, embodying a certain relatable tourist naivet\u00e9. His initial interactions appear gentle, almost endearing, creating an impression of a simple man trying to make the most of his trip. However, this superficial kindness soon reveals itself as a profound emotional void. He remains oblivious to his wife\u2019s evident unhappiness, her confession of infidelity, and the growing chasm within his family. His focus on trivialities, like selecting the perfect photo, starkly contrasts with his inability to engage with the deeper emotional landscape of his loved ones. This passive detachment, rather than developing into understanding, solidifies into a pervasive indifference. By the story\u2019s end, his lack of introspection or capacity for genuine connection transforms initial empathy into a quiet frustration, confirming his tragic inability to evolve beyond his self-imposed emotional isolation.",
        "In a narrow sense, the \u201czero-sum story\u201d is a belief that there is a competition between racial groups, and any progress for one group is a threat to the resources and position of another (McGhee). This story is the mainstream paradigm for conservative media and has been told in different forms for years. The negative impacts of the \u201czero-sum\u201d paradigm on the United States are massive and diverse. This mindset created additional economic, political, and social costs for all citizens of the United States. One of the prominent examples demonstrated by McGhee is the defunding of public goods and services, such as swimming pools or schools, when they became racially integrated. Rather than share, some communities chose to dismantle or privatize these essential resources, believing that any benefit to a minority group diminished their own. This shortsightedness created significant economic costs, as public infrastructure deteriorated and required more expensive private alternatives or future reinvestment. Politically, it fueled divisive rhetoric and policies, hindering bipartisan cooperation on critical national issues and eroding trust in democratic institutions. Socially, the zero-sum mindset deepened racial divides, fostered resentment, and prevented the collaborative problem-solving necessary for a cohesive society. Ultimately, this paradigm, by framing progress as a finite pie to be fought over, has undermined collective well-being, proving that when one group is held back, the entire nation pays the price.",
        "One of the key aspects of the assessment includes risk analysis and goal setting, both of which enable a clearer direction and more detailed as well as the focused planning process. The video provides an insightful demonstration of how risk assessment and goal setting are conducted when dealing with a client. The assessment session begins with the risk assessment process, where a counselor asks a client whether or not he or she has suicidal thoughts. Regardless of the answer, the video shows that the counselor asks the client to report if she will start having such inclinations (Dr. Todd Grande, 2016). A similar structure is applied to other potential risks, such as self-harm or harm to others, ensuring all immediate safety concerns are thoroughly addressed and monitored. Only after establishing a baseline of safety does the session transition into the equally crucial phase of goal setting. Here, the counselor collaboratively works with the client to identify achievable objectives. This collaborative approach, as depicted, empowers the client, fostering a sense of ownership over their therapeutic journey. Goals are often broken down into smaller, manageable steps, making the overall process less daunting and more actionable. This structured approach, moving from immediate risk mitigation to empowering goal formulation, exemplifies a comprehensive and client-centered assessment model, ultimately paving the way for targeted interventions and meaningful progress.",
        "The 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was introduced in the second half of the 19th century, manifesting the abolition of slavery across the country. According to the text, every citizen of the U.S. can neither enslave people nor be enslaved by fellow U.S. residents regardless of gender, race, age, or any other characteristic (U.S. Const. amend. 13, \u00a7 1). The abolition of slavery across the state has impacted U.S. history and the life of every American citizen, as this process initiated the restoration of individual freedom, though initially incomplete, marked a profound shift in the nation's moral and legal landscape. It legally dismantled an institution that had contradicted the very ideals of liberty upon which the United States was founded. While the amendment itself did not eradicate racial discrimination or guarantee full equality\u2014issues that would plague the nation for another century\u2014it provided the essential constitutional basis for subsequent civil rights movements and legislation. It affirmed that no person, regardless of their background, could be treated as property, thereby setting a crucial precedent for human dignity and autonomy. The 13th Amendment thus serves as a cornerstone of American civil liberties, a testament to the nation's ongoing, albeit sometimes faltering, journey towards a more just and equitable society where the promise of freedom extends to all.",
        "Overpopulation in cities has become one of the most critical problems of our time. This is both an environmental and a social problem. The city cannot grow indefinitely and provide decent workplaces for every resident. The ecological burden is also increasing. Uncontrolled growth in the number of cities leads to the unchecked spread of pollution and the escalation of poverty. However, there are several preventive measures that the Government can implement to combat this problem. First of all, overpopulation in cities is congestion and traffic jams, which lead to serious pollution problems. Atmospheric pollution is the most serious in cities, and its primary source is vehicular emissions and industrial activities. This creates smog, respiratory illnesses, and contributes heavily to global warming. Socially, overpopulation strains public services, leading to inadequate housing, overburdened healthcare, and rising unemployment, fostering poverty and crime. To mitigate these crises, governments must prioritize sustainable urban planning, promoting vertical development and green infrastructure. Decentralizing economic opportunities to smaller towns can alleviate urban migration. Investing in efficient public transportation systems is vital to reduce traffic and pollution. Furthermore, public awareness on responsible resource consumption and family planning empowers citizens towards a more balanced urban future.",
        "When it comes to people I find most fascinating and interesting, Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of them. This man is a famous astrophysicist and planetary scientist who shares his opinions and knowledge on various platforms. Personally, I find the pieces of information he provides mind-opening and shocking at times. I believe that this person knows a lot of controversial information and has various opinions on such matters, which would be pretty interesting to know. Neil deGrasse Tyson was born in 1958 and received several degrees from various universities, including Harvard, the University of Texas at Austin, and Columbia University.\n\nHis extensive academic background underpins his unique ability to translate the vast complexities of the cosmos into understandable and captivating narratives for the general public. Whether through his hosting of *Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey*, his popular podcast *StarTalk*, or his active presence on social media, Tyson possesses a remarkable talent for making astrophysics not just accessible, but incredibly exciting. He often challenges our anthropocentric view, presenting cosmic perspectives that shrink our perceived significance while simultaneously expanding our wonder. His insights, whether on the true nature of Pluto or the immense scale of the universe, frequently prompt a re-evaluation of our place within it. It\u2019s this blend of profound knowledge, articulate communication, and a willingness to tackle challenging scientific concepts that makes him such an enduring and inspirational figure in science communication today, sparking curiosity in countless individuals.",
        "Individual freedoms and national security are sometimes seen as two opposites. However, in ideal, national security should reflect the balanced relationship between the two mentioned concepts. Moreover, the principle of the prevalence of individual freedoms over the national security underlies the democratic idea. Individual freedoms include individual rights and are protected by the US Constitution (Longley). This paper argues that individual freedoms should never be sacrificed in the name of national security. This essay proposes that the protection of individual freedoms by maintaining national security is a fundamental principle and goal of democracy. US President Joe Biden notes, \u201cI strongly believe that our strength lies in our liberties, and true security cannot come at the cost of our fundamental rights.\" Sacrificing civil liberties for security betrays democratic ideals. It creates a false sense of safety, weakening the social contract and fostering distrust. Genuine security requires unwavering commitment to individual rights, ensuring measures are proportionate, temporary, and democratically overseen. A truly secure nation empowers its free citizens.",
        "The introduced Canadian perspective on the provisional agenda of the North Atlantic Council seems to cover key points that concern Canadian security. Increased presence in the world peace operations and maintenance of tight relationships with other NATO members, especially remarkable is the smart defense approach that considers the military and economic needs of Canada. Although, it is difficult to judge the extent of the Syrian threat to Canadian interest during the outbreak of coronavirus, which seems to continue even today. Therefore, it would be essential to review the proposed question for a more effective approach to the defense of Canadian interests. Nevertheless, this act protects the interest of Canada by ensuring its active participation in collective security frameworks. By strengthening ties with NATO allies, Canada not only shares the burden of global security but also amplifies its diplomatic influence. The smart defense strategy, while fiscally responsible, allows Canada to contribute meaningfully to peace operations and maintain crucial capabilities, even as the nature of threats evolves. While the direct impact of the Syrian conflict on Canada might be debated, the interconnectedness of global security means that instability anywhere can have ripple effects, including terrorism or refugee crises. Therefore, a proactive and collaborative approach, as championed by Canada within NATO, remains indispensable for safeguarding national interests in a perpetually changing and unpredictable world.",
        "One of the main purposes of a leader of a business is to select the best course of action out of the available alternatives when it comes to the process of decision-making. Clearly enough, it is impossible without a thorough understanding of a company's business environment. When it comes to entering the market with the goods for the purchasers' consumption, the one theory that specialists often take to is the supply and demand theory. This theory is utilized to understand the customers' buying behaviors and help managers strategize the product in the market in accordance with them. For instance, a lack of demand for a particular product might signal that its price is too high, its marketing is ineffective, or it simply doesn't meet consumer needs. Conversely, high demand could indicate an opportunity to increase production or even slightly raise prices, maximizing revenue. A savvy leader, armed with insights from supply and demand analysis, can then make informed choices: whether to lower prices, invest in promotional campaigns, innovate the product, or reallocate resources. This theoretical framework provides a vital lens through which to interpret market signals, anticipate consumer responses, and ultimately, guide the business towards profitability and sustainable growth, ensuring that crucial decisions are grounded in empirical understanding rather than mere conjecture.",
        "The creation of a web-based system to store the university's information on students and their transcripts presents certain risks that need to be addressed in the feasibility report. Using the standard risk evaluation process, it is possible to differentiate the risks into two large groups. These are risks to the continuation and completion of the project and risks to the end product's performance after the project has been completed. The risks to the continuation and completion of the project are as follows: * Unforeseen delays and time expenditures. It is possible that the project's implementation will be more complex than anticipated, requiring more time; this could stem from integrating legacy systems, unforeseen technical hurdles, or insufficient resource allocation. Budget overruns and scope creep also significantly threaten the project's viability and timely completion.\n\nConversely, risks to the end product's performance are equally critical. Data security is paramount; breaches could compromise sensitive student data, leading to privacy violations and reputational damage. System reliability and availability are also key concerns, as downtime would hinder essential university operations. Furthermore, ensuring data integrity for accurate records and scalability for future growth must be thoroughly evaluated to guarantee a robust system post-completion.",
        "The concept of \u201cgender roles\u201d is often applied to the analysis and comprehension of writings from various historical periods. These responsibilities appear to have been firmly defined during the Anglo-Saxon period. The poem Beowulf belongs to the epic or heroic poetry genre, which has poems that commemorate the characters' brave and martial actions. Women are portrayed as belongings for the advantage of the men throughout Beowulf and are made to support the male characters. In addition, women are utilized as plot devices to advance the story tale of men. Women, on the other hand, are a minor presence, often relegated to domestic or ceremonial roles, their voices largely unheard in the grand narratives of battle and heroism. Figures like Wealhtheow, while queen, primarily serve to maintain peace and offer hospitality, embodying the societal expectations for noblewomen to be peace-weavers and administrators of the household rather than active participants in warfare. Their value is frequently tied to their ability to secure alliances through marriage or to provide heirs, thus perpetuating the male lineage and power structures. Even Grendel's mother, though a formidable foe, is primarily defined by her maternal vengeance, a reaction to the male-dominated world's aggression. Ultimately, their limited portrayals underscore the rigidly patriarchal nature of Anglo-Saxon society, where a woman\u2019s worth was largely determined by her utility to men and the established social order.",
        "Everyone has read detective stories at least once in their life or watched detective programs on TV. Sometimes it could be seen that the heroes of the works use so-called indented writings. These writings can be on the second, third, and so on pages, depending on the pressure on the writing subject, that is, a pen or pencil. Even though such records are difficult to see, the examiners still have the experience and specialized equipment to ensure that this concealment was revealed. Indented writing is invisible indentations in the sheets of paper located under the page on which the information was originally written, forming a silent, often critical, hidden record. This fascinating forensic phenomenon, while frequently dramatized in fiction, holds immense real-world value for investigators. The subtle pressure applied during writing displaces the paper fibers, creating minute depressions that are imperceptible to the naked eye but can be scientifically recovered. Techniques like oblique lighting, which casts shadows to highlight the indentations, or more advanced methods such as Electrostatic Detection Devices (ESDD), are employed. ESDD works by applying an electrostatic charge to a film over the paper, attracting toner powder to the depressions and making the writing visible. The recovery of these clandestine messages can provide crucial evidence, from confessions to hidden plans, often proving pivotal in solving complex cases and bringing offenders to justice, demonstrating that even the most fleeting impressions can leave an indelible mark.",
        "President Franklin Roosevelt did much to end the Great Depression, which included passing acts and laws. They were aimed not only at restoring the economy and infrastructure but also at improving the situation of certain groups of the population. They included immigrants, African Americans, and workers, creating health clinics, special courses, college buildings, new schools, and recreation facilities, thus, increasing their quality of life. The first act I would like to analyze is the creation of the Public Works Administration (PWA). It was a Federal American Agency created during the New Deal by President Franklin Roosevelt (Corbett, 2014). This agency primarily focused on large-scale public works projects, such as dams, bridges, hospitals, and schools, providing much-needed employment during a period of rampant joblessness. For workers, including many African Americans and immigrants, the PWA offered steady wages and a sense of dignity, directly combating the economic despair. While challenges like racial discrimination persisted, the PWA\u2019s non-discrimination clauses, however imperfectly applied, represented a step towards more equitable employment. Beyond immediate job creation, the PWA's legacy is the enduring infrastructure that directly enhanced community well-being. The construction of new schools, college dormitories, and health clinics significantly improved access to education and healthcare. Furthermore, the development of parks and recreational facilities enriched the daily lives of citizens, fulfilling the New Deal\u2019s promise to uplift all Americans by fostering both economic recovery and social progress.",
        "Throughout history, interventions such as safety measures and quarantine were implemented to improve public safety. According to Rosenberg (2019), Mary Mallon was \u201cthe first \u201chealthy carrier\u201d of typhoid fever\u201d recognized in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century, which made her infamous as Typhoid Mary (para. 1). This woman was found to be a typhoid bacteria carrier, and healthcare authorities accused her of 47 illnesses and three deaths, isolating her on an island for most of her life (Rosenberg, 2019, para. 45). This extreme measure, while arguably effective in preventing further spread, ignited profound ethical debates concerning individual liberty versus public health imperatives. Mallon, a healthy individual, was deprived of her freedom not for a crime, but for a biological condition she neither understood nor could control. Her case became a landmark, forcing public health officials to grapple with the unprecedented challenge of asymptomatic carriers and the extent of state power in safeguarding communities. The harshness of her treatment underscores the difficult choices societies face when balancing the rights of the individual against the collective good. Ultimately, the story of Typhoid Mary remains a stark reminder of the complex ethical landscape surrounding public health interventions, a tension that continues to resonate in modern discussions about disease containment and personal autonomy.",
        "A digital engagement policy determines how the organization intends to position itself online. The regulation also covers the company's brand qualities and its vision and mission objectives. It also directs how employees can communicate digitally, both internally and externally, with suppliers and clients (Brown, 2019). In addition, the above guidelines also target social media interaction practices that may affect the business, either negatively or positively. Our organization has a digital engagement policy that it utilizes to protect the reputation of its brand. Moreover, the above strategy has enabled the business to increase employees' commitment while boosting the levels of their obligation. Hence, the policy acts as a comprehensive framework, fostering a culture of responsible digital citizenship among all staff. By clearly outlining acceptable online behaviors and communication protocols, it minimizes the risk of misrepresentation or accidental breaches of confidentiality. Employees feel more secure in their online interactions, knowing the boundaries and expectations, which in turn builds trust and a sense of collective responsibility for the company's image. This clarity not only safeguards the brand but also streamlines internal communication, ensuring consistent messaging and reducing ambiguity. Furthermore, by defining proper engagement with clients and suppliers, the policy cultivates stronger, more professional relationships, ultimately enhancing business opportunities and mitigating potential legal or reputational pitfalls. It is an indispensable tool for navigating the complexities of the modern digital landscape, ensuring sustained growth and a positive public perception.",
        "\u201cThe Passing of Traditional Societies\u201d is based on empirical material obtained from fieldwork and interviews conducted over a decade in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, and Iran. Lerner proceeded from the fact that in the process of modernization, all societies move in the same direction, which was set by the Western countries that had completed modernization earlier. However, this \u201cWestern model,\u201d according to Lerner, is, in fact, global. It acquired its name only due to a historical confluence of circumstances. Countries of the North Atlantic were the first to carry out **the comprehensive societal transformations encompassing industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of mass media.** Lerner argued these processes, initially Western, created a replicable pattern of modernization. Key to this was the development of \"empathy\"\u2014the capacity for individuals to imagine themselves in new roles, largely spurred by increased media exposure. As societies urbanized and literacy rates climbed, individuals gained social and physical mobility, eroding traditional social structures. Mass media, from print to broadcast, acted as a powerful agent, disseminating new ideas and lifestyles. Though historically rooted in the West, these patterns became a functional blueprint for development, adopted and adapted globally. Lerner saw this as a universal trajectory, where traditional societies inevitably move towards a modern, participant model, driven by these pervasive, interconnected forces.",
        "Miranda warning, also known as Miranda rights, is a formal statement in which a person being arrested is informed of their basic civil rights under the jurisdiction of the United States. Through this warning, an officer of the law enforcement notifies the individual of their right to remain silent, as well as to an attorney. Such principles reflect the foundation of the legal system of the United States, in which both sides are protected by a comprehensive set of rights in order to eliminate bias and enable an objective investigation of the case. The obligatory nature of the warning serves the interests of both sides of the legal process. For the individual, it acts as a crucial safeguard against self-incrimination and ensures access to legal counsel, preventing coerced confessions and upholding the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. This awareness is vital for an equitable defense, especially for those unfamiliar with legal procedures. Conversely, for law enforcement and the prosecution, adhering to Miranda ensures that any subsequent statements or evidence obtained are legally admissible in court. Failure to issue the warning can lead to the suppression of critical evidence, undermining the entire case. Thus, Miranda not only protects individual liberties but also maintains the integrity and legitimacy of the judicial system, fostering public trust in due process and reinforcing the principle that justice must be served fairly and lawfully for all.",
        "The editing in the first episode of the series Money Heist is in line with its thrilling plot and rapid action. In the first scene, as the character gets ready to exit her vehicle, the editing is quick, focusing on the items she is picking up. Similarly, the camera often focuses on objects, leading the viewer towards the items that will become an essential part of the narrative. For example, one can see the ringing phone before it is picked up. Moreover, the show uses rapid editing with close-ups and the use of objects that identify characters \u2013 guns, money, and other items. This deliberate visual strategy serves to immediately immerse the audience into the high-octane world of the heist. The fragmented, fast-paced cuts mirror the frantic energy and heightened tension experienced by the characters, effectively building suspense and foreshadowing the complex layers of the plot. By isolating specific items, the editing not only guides the viewer's attention but also subtly communicates crucial information, making the narrative more engaging and dynamic. This masterful technique ensures the pilot episode grabs viewers, establishing a relentless pace and an intricate visual language that defines the series.",
        "The concept of nursing is closely associated with the idea of continuous improvement, as the trends of health care need to mirror the existing social trends to provide the best care possible. One way to secure such care is to refer to the latest scholarly findings to modify the approaches to care provision in the workplace. This process of implementing research-based findings in daily patient care is known as evidence-based practice (EBP) (Wilson & Austria, 2021). Currently, EBP is not used actively by nurses for several reasons. First, the workload of most nurses discourages their desire to learn and embrace new research findings, as time for professional development is scarce amidst demanding shifts. Secondly, many nurses lack adequate training in critical appraisal skills, making it challenging to discern credible evidence from the vast amounts of information available. Furthermore, institutional barriers often exist, such as limited access to academic databases or a lack of mentorship from experienced EBP practitioners. Resistance to change within established hospital protocols and a preference for traditional methods also hinder EBP integration. Overcoming these obstacles requires a multi-faceted approach, including dedicated educational programs, protected time for research engagement, and leadership committed to fostering a culture of inquiry and evidence-based decision-making. Only then can EBP truly flourish, elevating patient outcomes and ensuring nursing practice remains at the forefront of healthcare innovation.",
        "Anorexia nervosa is a treatable eating disorder when people significantly limit the number of calories and types of foods they eat, which leads to excessive weight loss. Anyone may be affected by anorexia, and about 1-2% of the population suffers from the disorder (Cleveland Clinic Medical Staff, 2021). Key symptoms include: Emotional and mental signs: fear of gaining weight, obsession with counting calories or diets, irritability, self-criticism, and other characteristics. Behavioral signs: changes in eating habits, excessive exercise, and other features. Physical signs: weight loss, fatigue, dizziness, hair thinning, brittle nails, absence of menstruation (amenorrhea), and cold intolerance. These symptoms collectively underscore the severe impact anorexia has on an individual's physical well-being, often leading to serious medical complications affecting the heart, bones, and brain. Beyond the visible signs, the internal struggle is immense, characterized by a distorted body image and an overwhelming desire for control. Recognizing these multifaceted symptoms is crucial for early detection and intervention. While challenging, recovery is possible through a comprehensive approach involving medical, psychological, and nutritional support. Emphasizing the treatability of anorexia nervosa offers hope and highlights the necessity of compassionate, professional care for those grappling with this life-threatening condition.",
        "Global climate change, as has now been proven by the latest research, is caused by human activity. Awareness of the seriousness of the situation is gradually penetrating into world public opinion. There is still an opportunity to mitigate the consequences to avoid the worst. People can all unite in order to change the situation, even though this process may be gradual and take some time. The main difficulty is connected with the extremely uneven distribution of greenhouse gas emissions between developed and developing countries, large and small. However, it is possible to change the situation by taking small steps. For instance, the population should use public transport, thereby reducing individual carbon footprints. Furthermore, embracing energy-efficient appliances and supporting businesses committed to sustainable practices are accessible choices. On a broader scale, advocating for renewable energy policies and participating in local conservation efforts empowers communities. While the disparity in emissions between nations presents a complex challenge, the cumulative effect of these individual and community-level actions cannot be underestimated. They foster a collective consciousness and demonstrate a global commitment. This bottom-up momentum can then pressure governments and industries to implement more ambitious, equitable solutions, ensuring that the necessary large-scale transformations are not only discussed but actively pursued. A future where humanity thrives in harmony with nature begins with these seemingly small, but ultimately powerful, unified steps.",
        "Perspective is an important consideration in art, one that determines the way people look at a painting and what they see, how they see it, and how they interact with it. Additionally, it is responsible for the way people understand an image in its cultural context or intended meaning. While exploring the google arts and culture exhibit, I have been able to see a number of different religious paintings that use perspective in interesting ways. I think that the discussion of perspective is important for those both close and far from the art world, as it promotes engagement with paintings that can often be overlooked. To truly appreciate these works, one must consider how artists like those of the Renaissance manipulated vanishing points and foreshortening to guide the viewer\u2019s eye, often towards central figures like Christ or Mary. This wasn't merely a technical skill; it was a powerful tool for spiritual storytelling, creating a sense of depth and immediacy that made sacred narratives feel tangible and present. For instance, the dramatic use of linear perspective in altarpieces pulled the worshipper into the devotional space, fostering a personal connection with the divine. Even in earlier, more symbolic religious art, the *lack* of conventional perspective often conveyed a deliberate transcendence of earthly reality. Therefore, engaging with perspective, whether its presence or absence, allows us to unlock deeper layers of meaning and intent, transforming a quick glance into a profound encounter with history, faith, and human ingenuity.",
        "Gendered behavior denotes fundamental expressions of gender socialization and identity through an individual's various developmental phases. Thus, gendered behaviors refer to the ways persons behave according to their respective male or female genders (Au & Rudolfsdottir, 2021). One of the prominent gendered behaviors instilled in me during childhood was that women are the primary cooks in the home. Hence, from childhood, I learned how to prepare food for the family, unlike most male relatives around. Even the movies mostly depicted women as the cooks in the home. Perhaps the gendered role that I quickly internalized was this expectation of domesticity, particularly regarding cooking. While it initially felt natural, reinforced by family dynamics and media, as I matured, I began to observe the stark contrast with male relatives who were largely exempt from such responsibilities. This personal experience illuminated how deeply societal norms shape individual identities and behaviors from a young age. It prompted me to critically examine other seemingly 'natural' gendered behaviors, recognizing them not as innate differences but as learned patterns. Understanding this process of socialization has made me more aware of the subtle yet powerful ways gender roles are perpetuated, influencing everything from career choices to emotional expression, and highlighting the importance of challenging these ingrained perceptions for greater equality.",
        "Woman with a Parasol \u2013 Madame Monet and Her Son is a painting by the French artist Claude Monet, a founder and one of the most outstanding representatives of impressionism. Painted in 1875, this canvas became one of Monet's most well-known and influential works (Brodska\u00efa and Kalitina). The two figures in the painting are Monet's wife Camille and his son Jean. The lower third of the painting shows a grassy area, and the other two-thirds contain the figures of a woman and a little boy behind her. Beyond its simple subject matter, the painting exemplifies Impressionism's core tenets. Monet masterfully captures a fleeting moment, emphasizing the effects of natural light and atmosphere. Camille, standing atop a small rise, is bathed in brilliant sunlight, her white dress catching the luminous glow while shadows play across her face and the folds of her skirt. The quick, visible brushstrokes convey a powerful sense of movement, suggesting a breezy day, with the parasol and her veil appearing to flutter in the wind. This dynamic portrayal, combined with the vibrant greens of the grassy slope and the luminous blue of the sky punctuated by clouds, evokes a powerful sense of an idyllic, sun-drenched afternoon. It\u2019s more than just a portrait; it\u2019s an immersive experience of light, air, and the intimate bond of family, rendered with a remarkable freshness that continues to captivate and influence art lovers today.",
        "In the development of nursing in Europe in the 19th century, the activities of an outstanding personality, the Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, played an important role. Florence was looking for an opportunity to help the poor and the sick. At that distant time, activities related to mercy, helping those in need, were considered an occupation not worthy of a noblewoman. The young woman sacrificed personal life expensive relationships with her parents but remained faithful to her calling. Furthermore, her values and commitment allowed Florence to become a historical figure in modern nursing, to whose leadership people owe accolades for paving the way for its professionalization. Her pivotal work during the Crimean War starkly revealed the horrific conditions in military hospitals, where more soldiers died from preventable diseases than from battle wounds. Nightingale, armed with meticulous data collection and unwavering resolve, implemented radical reforms in sanitation, hygiene, and patient care. She transformed chaotic, unsanitary environments into organized, healing spaces, dramatically reducing mortality rates. Beyond the battlefield, her influence extended to establishing the Nightingale Training School at St. Thomas' Hospital in London, laying the foundational curriculum for modern nursing education. By emphasizing training, discipline, and scientific observation, Florence Nightingale elevated nursing from a disreputable service to a respected, vital profession, forever changing healthcare's landscape and inspiring generations of caregivers.",

        "In order to understand the structure and functions of society, it is essential to study a vast number of sociological theories and perspectives created by various scientists. For example, Emile Durkheim, a French sociologist, expressed his view of society in the theory of functionalism. According to Durkheim, there is vital interconnectivity of all the elements of any society that share common ideas and principles, and the sum of these elements is not as great as the society itself. The sociologist viewed society as a huge biological organism that requires all its parts to function properly in order to maintain social equilibrium and cohesion.\n\nEach social institution \u2013 from family and education to government and religion \u2013 serves a specific purpose, much like organs in a body. These institutions work together to fulfill society's needs, contributing to its stability and survival. Durkheim emphasized the concept of the 'collective consciousness,' the shared beliefs and moral attitudes that bind individuals together, creating a sense of solidarity. When this collective consciousness is strong, society functions harmoniously. However, disruptions to this shared understanding, such as rapid social change, can lead to 'anomie,' a state of normlessness where individuals feel disconnected and purposeless, threatening the societal organism's health. Understanding this intricate interplay of social structures and functions is crucial for diagnosing societal problems and promoting collective well-being.",
        "The case under consideration, Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S., was significant for developing measures to avoid discrimination in the workplace. More specifically, it was primarily related to diversity in terms of sex and age since this combination frequently evokes the concerns of the population (King, 2021). The examination of the issue by relying on the example of Gerald Bostock was advantageous for establishing proper employment practices in this respect. In this lawsuit filed by the plaintiff, the main factor was his unjustified dismissal from the company in which he had otherwise positive reputation. This event was directly linked to his sexual orientation, as he was fired shortly after his employer learned he had joined a gay softball league. Bostock, along with two other plaintiffs in similar cases consolidated by the Supreme Court, argued that discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity was inherently a form of sex discrimination, prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Court, in a landmark 6-3 decision, agreed. Justice Gorsuch, writing for the majority, reasoned that if an employer fires a male employee for being attracted to men, but would not fire a female employee for being attracted to men, then the discrimination is based on the employee's sex. This interpretation significantly expanded protections for LGBTQ+ individuals in the workplace, clarifying that sex discrimination encompasses more than just traditional binary distinctions. The ruling underscored a commitment to fostering truly inclusive work environments, where an individual's identity, rather than their performance, is not a barrier to employment. It set a precedent that any employment practice failing to account for diversity in this expanded sense risked legal challenge, pushing companies towards more equitable hiring and retention strategies.",
        "The work of a clinical or medical office worker is characterized by a combination of a large number of administrative operations with medical activities. Primarily, these professionals are office assistants filling out paperwork and interacting with staff (\u201cHow to become a medical office assistant,\u201d 2021). As a result, I will be approaching interviews for this job in a professional business style. While the fitting suit can be expensive, I already have the proper formal attire.

My verbal communication will be clear, concise, and respectful, demonstrating active listening\u2014crucial for patient and staff interactions. I will practice articulating my organizational abilities and attention to detail, vital for accurate record-keeping and managing appointments. Non-verbal cues, like maintaining eye contact and a confident posture, will also be considered. Furthermore, I will thoroughly research the specific clinic\u2019s mission and services to tailor my responses, showcasing genuine interest. By combining a professional appearance with well-prepared communication, I aim to convey my readiness and enthusiasm for the multifaceted responsibilities of a medical office worker.",
        "With the widespread use of digital technology, email has gained particular importance. With email, communication has become much easier, as people have been able to communicate with colleagues, relatives, loved ones, and business partners and representatives of organizations, literally in real-time, avoiding all the difficulties of \u201cphysical\u201d communication. However, what is interesting is a study of the extent to which such communication has been modified with the advent of the phenomenon of email. In the context of interpersonal communication, two effects should be highlighted. First, email has meaningfully broadened the scope of communication so that individuals can effortlessly connect across vast geographical distances and time zones. Old barriers like cost and accessibility have dissolved, enabling more frequent and less formal exchanges with distant relatives, old friends, and professional contacts. Its asynchronous nature also allows for more thoughtful, considered responses, fostering dialogue that might otherwise be impossible.\n\nSecond, the very *nature* of interpersonal communication has been subtly altered. Relying solely on the written word, email inherently strips away crucial non-verbal cues \u2013 like tone of voice or facial expressions \u2013 vital in face-to-face interactions. This absence often leads to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of intent. While incredibly efficient, email demands greater precision in language to convey nuance, pushing users to be more explicit in their written communication. Ultimately, email offers unprecedented reach but fundamentally reshapes the dynamics of human connection.",
        "The concepts of domestic violence and abuse refer to psychologically or physically aggressive behavior of one family member towards another. This aggression could take the form of beating, rape, screaming, and humiliation. Unfortunately, in the modern world, these are common phenomena. According to statistics provided by Huecker et al. (2021), 10 million Americans per year suffer from violence and abuse. The victims of domestic violence and abuse feel depressed and helpless, and their self-esteem is also extremely low. Fear of the aggressor might force a victim to keep calm about the experience of being abused. Nonetheless, breaking this silence is crucial for healing and recovery. Victims need to understand that they are not alone and that help is available through various support systems, including hotlines, shelters, and counseling services. Society has a collective responsibility to create safe spaces where survivors feel empowered to speak out without fear of judgment or retaliation. Education about the signs of abuse and the resources available can equip individuals to identify and intervene in harmful situations. Ultimately, fostering a culture of empathy and accountability is essential to combating domestic violence, ensuring that victims can reclaim their lives and build a future free from fear and oppression.",
        "Being a knowledgeable and experienced professional in one's professional sphere is, without a doubt, of great importance. For this reason, many students of medical education facilities seek to acquire as much theoretical and practical expertise as possible before graduation. Although such a strategy is by no means wrong, I have recently discovered that the true success in the work of healthcare providers is explained by the doctor's ability to build relationships with one's patients. I fully understood the advantage of this simple but often overlooked truth when observing Dr. Wang's work. Dr. Wang is an experienced professional working in the sphere of eye care.\n\nHer consultations were never rushed; she took the time to listen intently to patients' concerns, not just their symptoms. She explained complex diagnoses and treatment plans in accessible language, ensuring patients felt informed and empowered, rather than overwhelmed. More than her clinical prowess, it was her genuine empathy and ability to connect on a human level that truly set her apart. Patients confided in her, trusted her judgment implicitly, and were more likely to adhere to her recommendations. This relational approach fostered an environment of trust and mutual respect, demonstrating that while medical knowledge is foundational, the human connection is the bedrock of truly effective healthcare. It\u2019s a lesson that transcends the clinic, highlighting the profound impact of compassion in any professional field.",
        "Various cultures around the world have unique creation myths and traditional methods of presenting them through art. The cosmology of the Aztec civilization was quite different from the Europeans that conquered them. Firstly, the Europeans' Christian God \u201ccreated mankind in his own image\u201d and granted him dominion over a perfectly constructed world, the Garden of Eden (Holy Bible, New International Version, Genesis 1:27). In the Bible, he is described as a benevolent, if strict, father figure who can forgive humankind their sins and grant them eternal redemption. Consequently, God is depicted in art as a wise, often elderly, patriarch, frequently surrounded by light or angels, embodying divine wisdom and authority, sometimes with a stern but ultimately loving expression. This reflects a worldview where humanity is central and creation is a gift.\n\nIn stark contrast, Aztec cosmology was cyclical, driven by the constant struggle and sacrifice of gods to sustain the world and prevent its destruction. Their deities, like Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca, were powerful, often fearsome beings who demanded human blood and self-sacrifice to maintain cosmic balance. Aztec art, therefore, portrays these gods with intricate, often terrifying features \u2013 sharp teeth, claws, and adornments of sacrificial tools or human hearts \u2013 emphasizing their immense power, their dual benevolent and destructive nature, and humanity's subservient, sacrificial role in a precarious universe. These artistic expressions vividly illustrate the profound divergence in their respective understandings of creation, humanity\u2019s place, and divine interaction.",
        "It isn't easy to single out the central directions and build a particular hierarchy in the modern art world, including music. Some of the performers influence the minds of young people, and political strategists can use some compositions during elections. The current state of the art is too vague to make clear statements on this subject. Hip-hop performers expose many of the problems of megacities and young people: drugs, cruelty, violence, and lack of life guidelines (Rabinowitch, 2020). The social movement for women's rights is significant for the modern generation, and female performers are becoming powerful voices, embodying the spirit of empowerment and challenging established norms. Artists like Billie Eilish or Olivia Rodrigo, for instance, resonate deeply with youth by articulating anxieties and triumphs often overlooked. Their lyrical honesty, combined with unique artistic expression, creates a space for introspection and solidarity. This shows that despite the apparent lack of a singular direction, modern music actively engages with, and indeed shapes, contemporary social discourse. It reflects our collective struggles and aspirations, proving that art, even when seemingly amorphous, retains its profound capacity to influence and unite. Its true power lies in its diverse, responsive nature.",
        "The primary source for this study is the general medical journal The Lancet. It publishes the survey data and provides statistics and a comparative analysis of the obtained quantitative information. The Economist can be seen as a secondary source that describes research with less digital content. The study represents a decrease in the HIV infection rate of girls in school by stabilizing their families' financial difficulties. The World Bank funded the study to demonstrate the value of money in reducing the spread of HIV among young, poor girls. The study was authored by Berk \u00d6zler, Lead Economist and Poverty Research Manager. The medical journal The Lancet underscores a critical, yet often overlooked, intersection between economic stability and public health outcomes. This research, led by an economist, powerfully demonstrates that poverty is not merely a social issue but a profound determinant of health vulnerabilities, particularly for marginalized populations such as young, impoverished girls. By establishing a direct correlation between financial support and a reduction in HIV incidence, the study presents a compelling case for integrating targeted socioeconomic interventions into comprehensive global health strategies. It advocates for an approach where investing in family welfare and education yields significant public health dividends, offering a more holistic and sustainable path to combating epidemics. This interdisciplinary methodology, championed by the World Bank, serves as a vital model for future development initiatives addressing complex global challenges.",
        "There are numerous US criminal cases that raise the question of trying juvenile offenders in adult courts. Currently, almost in half of the states in the country, juveniles can be prosecuted and tried in adult courts. Pennsylvania is one such state, as there is no lower limit for the age someone can be charged as an adult with homicide. The 2009 case involving a double murder illustrates the numerous issues that take place in all similar cases. In February 2009, state police found 26-year-old Kenzie Houk, who was eight months pregnant, in her bed with a bullet through her head. Jordan **Brown, the 11-year-old son of Houk's boyfriend, was swiftly identified as the prime suspect. His arrest and subsequent charging as an adult for two counts of homicide\u2014one for Kenzie and one for her unborn child\u2014ignited a national debate on juvenile justice. The decision to try an 11-year-old in an adult court, despite his limited cognitive development and understanding of legal proceedings, highlighted the stark realities of Pennsylvania's archaic 'no lower age limit' statute for serious crimes. Critics argued that such a system disregards the unique psychological and emotional needs of children, often leading to harsher penalties and reduced opportunities for rehabilitation compared to the juvenile justice system. This case underscored the profound ethical dilemma of balancing public safety with the principle that children, even those accused of heinous crimes, should be treated in a manner that considers their age and capacity for change, rather than being subjected to the full weight of the adult criminal justice system.**",
        "Thich Quang Duc committed self-immolation on the streets of Saigon on June 11, 1963, and it changed the course of history. Today, the photograph of Thich Quang Duc's death, The Burning Monk, has become a universal symbol of rebellion and the fight against injustice. His death was reduced to a symbol, but it was much more than that (Sinzelle, 22). It was an act of defiance against a corrupt government that had killed its citizens. It sparked a revolution, overthrew the regime, and may even have caused the Americans to enter the Vietnam War more deeply. The horrifying image, captured by Malcolm Browne, instantly galvanized international condemnation against the Ngo Dinh Diem regime's persecution of Buddhists. This singular act of protest ripped through the carefully constructed fa\u00e7ade of stability, exposing the regime's brutality and sparking widespread civil unrest. Within months, the Diem government, having lost all legitimacy and international support, was overthrown in a military coup. While the subsequent political instability further complicated the geopolitical landscape, Thich Quang Duc's sacrifice undeniably served as a powerful catalyst for change, demonstrating the extreme lengths to which individuals would go to oppose oppression. His act remains a potent reminder that symbols derive their power from profound human suffering and the unwavering courage to stand against injustice, forever etching itself into the annals of resistance.",
        "In the grand scheme of things, prosecutors and victims of violent crimes are natural allies. The prosecutors strive to bring the offenders to justice, whether to fulfill their duty before the law or achieve career progress. At the same time, the victims get moral satisfaction when the criminals are brought to justice. Therefore, one might think that prosecutors and victims are naturally supposed to cooperate. However, this logical scenario does not necessarily happen in practice. Sometimes, the victims cannot adequately cooperate with the prosecutors due to the experienced shock, fear, or mistreatment in the prosecutor's office. During the often-intimidating legal process, victims may feel re-victimized by a system that prioritizes procedure over their emotional well-being. A lack of sensitivity from legal professionals, repeated recounting of traumatic events, or a perception of being a mere witness rather than a central figure in their own justice can compound their distress. This can lead to reluctance to testify, provide crucial details, or even withdraw from the process entirely. When victims feel unheard or exploited, the essential trust required for effective collaboration shatters. The consequences are dire: cases weaken, offenders might evade accountability, and victims are left feeling betrayed by the very system designed to protect them. True justice requires not just legal acumen but profound empathy, ensuring victims are supported, not further traumatized, throughout their pursuit of closure.",
        "The artist's name: Unknown; The title of the artifact: Nefertiti Bust; The date of the artifact completed: 1331-1354 BC; The size of the artifact: 47 cm high; The medium of the artifact: Sculpture. One of the cultural artifacts that denote the life of women in Ancient Egypt is the sculpture under the title Nefertiti Bust. It is a life-sized 47-cm high bust of the queen of Egypt, Nefertiti, who was pharaoh's wife and lived in the 13 th century BC. This iconic piece, crafted from painted limestone, embodies the artistic innovation of the Amarna period and offers profound insights into the status and representation of elite women in antiquity.\n\nNefertiti, whose name means \"the beautiful one has come,\" was not merely a consort but a powerful figure, possibly even co-regent with her husband, Akhenaten. The bust captures her striking beauty, characterized by a long, elegant neck, balanced features, and a distinctive blue crown. Its remarkably preserved colors and lifelike rendering suggest it was a model for other sculptures or a private devotional piece. The bust's existence underlines the significant, albeit often idealized, role women could play at the highest echelons of Egyptian society. It serves as a timeless testament to ancient Egyptian artistry and the enduring legacy of one of history\u2019s most enigmatic queens, continuing to captivate audiences worldwide from its home in Berlin\u2019s Neues Museum.",
        "In 2020, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-05, which deferred the effective dates of Topic 606 and Topic 842 by one year. This update gave private companies a much-needed relief, which was overwhelmed by numerous challenges associated with fighting off the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though many companies had adopted the new revenue recognition policy, both preparers and auditors experienced significant difficulties applying the new accounting standards in practice. The central problem was that the new standard, unlike GAAP, does not provide sufficient detail on the implementation.\n\nThis absence of prescriptive guidance forced companies to rely heavily on professional judgment, leading to diverse interpretations for similar transactions. For Topic 606, complex contracts with multiple performance obligations or variable consideration posed significant challenges in allocating transaction prices and identifying distinct goods or services. Similarly, Topic 842 introduced complexities in determining the appropriate discount rate for private companies or identifying embedded leases. This ambiguity increased the burden on accounting teams, demanding more resources for analysis, documentation, and external consultation, ultimately escalating compliance costs. While principles-based standards promote flexibility, the initial lack of comprehensive application examples hampered consistent adoption and created comparability issues. This underscored the ongoing need for clearer interpretive guidance and practical examples from regulators.",
        "Elements Diamonds by Rihanna was first heard on Elvis Duran Show on September 26, 2012, availed for online download an hour after being released to the public, and was released as the album's lead single the following day. Sia wrote the song for Rihanna, who holds the song's copyrights and worked on it a year prior; therefore, the song is owned by an independent contractor (Anggraini 12). Unapologetic is Barbadian artist Rihanna's seventh studio album, and the song \u201cDiamonds\u201d appears on it (Anggraini 12). The track quickly became a global sensation, showcasing a departure from Rihanna's more aggressive previous singles towards a more introspective and vulnerable sound. Lyrically, \"Diamonds\" speaks of finding light and hope in a relationship, embracing resilience, and the beauty of human connection, themes that resonated deeply with listeners worldwide. Its minimalistic production, characterized by a prominent synth melody and a powerful vocal performance, allowed the emotional weight of Sia's songwriting to shine through. The song achieved massive commercial success, topping charts in over 20 countries and becoming one of Rihanna's signature anthems. \"Diamonds\" remains a powerful testament to her artistic evolution and enduring appeal.",
        "The video \u201cPlay is more than just fun\u201d features a bio-psycho-social-spiritual issue of play and its importance in people's life. The concept of play is regarded as a developmental issue, connecting a person's body to his brain through some links. The play is considered a significant part of people's lives since it allows individuals to hone their skills, manual and mental (Brown, 2008). Moreover, through play, a person's values may be developed. Group play allows developing such qualities as loyalty to one's group, codependence, and the spirit of cooperation and healthy competition. Socially, play fosters empathy, communication, and conflict resolution skills, essential for navigating complex human relationships. It\u2019s a foundational mechanism for building communities and understanding social norms, often through unspoken rules and shared experiences. Psychologically, play serves as a vital outlet for stress, anxiety, and trauma, allowing individuals to process emotions and develop resilience. It nurtures creativity, problem-solving, and imagination, critical for innovation and adapting to new challenges throughout life. Spiritually, engaging in playful activities can evoke a sense of joy, wonder, and connection, transcending the mundane and offering moments of pure presence. Therefore, play isn't merely a pastime; it\u2019s a fundamental human need that cultivates holistic well-being from childhood through adulthood, supporting cognitive, emotional, and social flourishing.",
        "The work Promises and challenges of Blockchain in education by Jae Park examines the blockchain concept, which has the potential to become a leading socio-economic technology in the context of network neutrality and big data. This study suggests that current trends in the Internet space will set new standards for digital ownership and storage. A comprehensive study of industrial and financial blockchain will greatly contribute to crypto education, crypto administration, human resources management, financial procurement, and other related fields. The principal purpose of the study is to observe the proposed tasks set by blockchain technology and the challenges expected in this direction. Blockchain was originally developed as the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies, but its potential in education is transformative. It promises to establish new standards for digital ownership and storage, particularly for academic credentials like diplomas and transcripts. This verifiable, immutable record could revolutionize human resources management by simplifying verification and combating fraud, aligning with the study's goals.\n\nYet, significant challenges exist. Implementing blockchain requires addressing scalability, energy consumption, and regulatory frameworks. Crucially, a robust \"crypto education\" curriculum is needed to equip users with the necessary understanding. Privacy concerns surrounding student data and the complex integration with legacy systems also pose considerable hurdles. Navigating these technical and ethical challenges will determine blockchain's true impact on educational administration and learning experiences.",
        "The story of the extreme rise and the following fall of the Enron Corporation still interests many people. Not everyone is aware of all the circumstances and factors that affected the company's struggle, and only some people know how many resources, including places and people, were involved in the corporation. The record-breaking bankruptcy of \u201cthe seventh largest company in the United States and the sixth largest energy company in the world\u201d was surprising for the society (The Nigerian Professional Accountant, n.d., para. 2). This company was founded in 1985, and its first year in the market marked the beginning of an aggressive expansion strategy. Under Kenneth Lay's leadership, Enron quickly diversified from natural gas pipelines into electricity, pulp and paper, and even broadband. This rapid growth, often lauded as innovative, was driven by market deregulation and a culture that prized ambition. However, this seemingly unstoppable rise concealed a dark underbelly of sophisticated financial deception. Enron extensively used special purpose entities (SPEs) and mark-to-market accounting to obscure massive debts and inflate earnings, creating an illusion of robust profitability. This intricate web of fraud, involving top executives and external auditors, ultimately led to its spectacular collapse. The Enron scandal remains a pivotal case study, highlighting the devastating consequences of corporate greed and a profound failure of ethical governance.",
        "Ageism is a global problem of discriminating and stereotyping people based on their age. It contributes to prejudice in society, causing a psychological impact on individuals and creating biased attitudes toward certain populations (Ayalon & Tesch-R\u00f6mer, 2018). Media is often responsible for stereotyping different age groups, in particular, older adults. This paper aims to discuss two examples of ageism and one example of a positive characterization of the elderly in the media. Cliches and stereotypes about older adults in advertising cause negative attitudes in people as they present unrealistic and out-of-touch messages to consumers. For instance, advertisements frequently depict older adults as either frail, technologically inept, or comically out-of-touch, reinforcing stereotypes of incompetence and irrelevance. Such portrayals reduce the elderly to their age-related challenges, ignoring their diverse lives and experiences. Similarly, media often overlooks the sexual or romantic lives of older individuals, perpetuating the myth that vitality diminishes with age.\n\nIn contrast, positive representations are emerging. The British TV series *Last Tango in Halifax* offers a refreshing portrayal of older protagonists, depicting them as vibrant, complex individuals embarking on new relationships and navigating family dynamics. These characters defy stereotypes, showcasing continued vitality, wisdom, and active societal participation. By presenting multi-dimensional realities, media can actively challenge ageist biases, fostering a more nuanced and inclusive understanding of aging.",
        "Gender Stereotypes and Discrimination Nowadays, gender stereotypes and sexual discrimination make people confront various issues which may lead to negative consequences. For instance, Sandberg (2010) discusses why men reach top positions in the workforce much more often than women. During her lecture, Sandberg addresses this problem by providing current statistics on the male and female employment gap, suggesting that it is highly more challenging for women to choose between personal life and career success. Overall, the Ted Talk is highly insightful, offering the viewers a chance to reflect on modern gender inequality difficulties. In this Ted Talk, Sandberg also advocates for women to \"lean in\" to their careers, urging them not to preemptively opt out of opportunities due to anticipated family responsibilities. She highlights the subtle societal pressures and unconscious biases that often steer women away from ambition or limit their perceived potential. This pervasive issue extends beyond corporate boardrooms, manifesting in educational settings, domestic roles, and even the toys children are given. Such entrenched stereotypes not only hinder individual growth but also deprive society of diverse perspectives and talents, perpetuating an imbalance that stifles progress and innovation. Addressing these deeply ingrained biases requires systemic changes and a conscious effort from individuals to challenge traditional norms.",
        "The clothing industry is amongst the many monopolistically competitive industries. There are many clothing firms in the industry competing against each other while producing similar products. However, the firms in the industry earn competitive advantages by distinguishing their products through branding and advertisements (Davis and \u00d6zg\u00fcr, 4). Product differentiation is one of the strategies commonly used by monopolistic competitive firms. Product differentiation in a clothing firm can involve designs, the quality of materials used, and the prices charged for the clothes. In advertisements, differentiation is put in physical aspects such as color, designs, elastic, and different sizes (Davis and \u00d6zg\u00fcr, 4). By emphasizing these unique attributes, firms aim to create a distinct identity that resonates with specific consumer segments. For instance, a brand might focus on sustainable materials to attract environmentally conscious buyers, or on innovative cuts to appeal to fashion-forward individuals. This strategic differentiation allows firms to command a degree of market power, moving away from being mere price-takers. While they cannot entirely escape competitive pressures, successful product differentiation fosters brand loyalty, enabling firms to charge slightly higher prices or maintain market share even when new competitors emerge. Ultimately, this dynamic environment benefits consumers through a wider array of choices tailored to diverse preferences, while pushing firms to constantly innovate and refine their offerings to stand out in a crowded marketplace.",
        "Subsidizing programs are considered welfare and net initiatives that the government takes to aid low-income families and individuals affected by poverty. These programs offset the essential needs of the citizens from health, food, housing, and education. Such an initiative aims to allow people access to quality services and save some money for their personal growth. The subject of whether the subsidizing of essentials causes an incentive or de-incentive to seek employment is a debatable one. An example of a subsidized program is the subsidized housing, House Vouchers, and Public Housing programs. This scheme was initiated specifically for **families and individuals struggling to afford safe, decent housing in the private market.**\n\n**The underlying premise is that by stabilizing foundational needs like shelter, recipients are better positioned to pursue employment or educational opportunities.** With a secure roof over their heads, the immense stress of housing insecurity is alleviated, freeing up mental and financial resources. This stability can empower individuals to invest in job training, educational programs, or dedicate more time to a thorough job search for a sustainable career, rather than being forced into immediate, low-wage employment out of desperation. However, some contend that the long-term provision of such aid might inadvertently decrease the immediate urgency to achieve full financial independence, creating a perceived disincentive. Ultimately, the effectiveness often hinges on program design and individual circumstances.",
        "The rock and music pop scene were introduced to and gained popularity on television through massive hit shows for teenagers. The three primary ones were Where the Action Is on CBS, Shinding on ABC, and Hullabaloo on NBC. As more households had access to televisions along with the growth of widespread range of programming, including musical ones, the television played a significant role in distributing the music to the public. The bands that appeared on these hit TV shows went on to see significant success in the charts. The television shows helped to articulate the new sort of youth music culture and almost became a visual anthem for a generation finding its voice. These programs offered more than just musical performances; they were a vibrant window into the burgeoning counter-culture, showcasing the latest fashion, dance moves, and attitudes that resonated deeply with young audiences. For many aspiring musicians, an appearance on these shows was a guaranteed ticket to stardom, instantly propelling their songs up the Billboard charts and transforming them into household names. The visual medium amplified the artists' charisma and stage presence, creating an immersive experience that radio alone could not provide. In essence, television transformed music consumption, turning it into a shared, nationwide phenomenon and solidifying its role as a powerful cultural force that transcended mere entertainment, profoundly shaping the identity of the 1960s youth.",
        "An aboriginal person is an individual characterized as a descendant of indigenous inhabitants of Australia. Before the arrival of Europeans, the indigenous people of Australia occupied most of the land, which they protected and fertilized to support cultivation. The aboriginal people mainly practiced hunting and gathering as their source of livelihood before adopting agricultural practices. The aboriginal people arrived in Australia from Asia via Southeast Asia and have inhabited the land between 45000 and 50000 years ago. After the arrival of European colonialists, the indigenous people faced many challenges such as economic, political, and disruption of their tradition. The aboriginal people lost their land, sovereignty, and traditional way of life. This dispossession led to profound economic hardship, as their established hunting and gathering grounds were seized and their sophisticated land management practices disregarded. Politically, they were stripped of their self-governance and subjected to colonial laws that often criminalized their customs and beliefs. Their spiritual connection to the land, vital for their identity and ceremonies, was severed, causing immense cultural trauma. Generations suffered from forced removals, assimilation policies, and widespread discrimination, leading to ongoing social and health disparities. Despite these adversities, Aboriginal communities have shown incredible resilience, striving to reclaim their heritage, language, and rights, advocating for recognition and reconciliation in modern Australia.",
        "The Alabama State constitution strives to provide and protect a wide array of citizens' rights. Most notably, some of these rights are replicated in the American Bill of Rights. Like the American Bill of Rights, the Alabama State constitution is equally detailed and has different sections that are dedicated to enhancing and protecting citizens' liberties. The standout element within the Alabama State constitution regarding the protection of rights is the freedom of speech. Within the Bill of Rights, The First Amendment guards the citizens' freedom of speech as it enables them to not only express themselves through speech but also via protest groups (Weinberger, 2018, p. 45). This fundamental right is crucial for a thriving democracy, allowing citizens to hold their government accountable and engage in public discourse. The Alabama Constitution, in Article I, Section 4, broadly declares that \"no law shall ever be passed to curtail or restrain the liberty of speech or of the press.\" This strong language underscores the state's commitment to individual expression, even in potentially controversial forms. While the specifics of its application have been debated, similar to federal interpretations, the intent remains clear: to foster an environment where diverse viewpoints can flourish without undue governmental interference. This robust protection, alongside guarantees for due process and property rights, showcases Alabama's dedication to upholding the foundational principles of liberty for all its residents.",
        "The American War of Independence is between the American colonies and Great Britain. The revolution's success eventually depended on the willingness of Americans to risk their lives and economic well-being in the name of patriotism. The revolution was a conservative attempt to preserve freedoms that seemed to be threatened by British politics. However, the war was accompanied by social and intellectual transformations that radically changed the nature of American politics and brought ordinary people into politics to an unprecedented degree. It was the main reason why the Patriots were willing to risk their lives for the sake of independence and change. Firstly, the Patriots wanted the American colonies to secure genuine self-governance and economic autonomy from a distant, increasingly perceived as tyrannical, British Parliament. They believed their fundamental rights as Englishmen, particularly the right to property and representative consent for taxation, were being systematically eroded. This defense of traditional liberties, however, rapidly evolved into a more radical vision inspired by Enlightenment principles of popular sovereignty and natural rights. The prospect of creating a republic where ordinary citizens had a direct voice in their government, free from the dictates of monarchy or aristocracy, was immensely compelling. It was the promise of this new, more equitable political order, combined with the defense of existing freedoms, that imbued their patriotism with such potent resolve, making the ultimate sacrifice seem not only necessary but also profoundly worthwhile.",
        "Software piracy passes as any act resulting in stealing legally protected software. The act's impact on the individual and society increases productivity risks through security holes that cause users to experience glitches and bugs. The outcome of the experience is frustrations, lost times, and lost work (Parson, n.d.). Two, the absence of warranties with the pirated software means they are exposed to increased security risks with the software containing viruses and associated malware that affect computers (Parson, n.d.). Third, the individual or society is exposed to legal risks associated with pirated software when caught using it. Beyond these immediate personal and operational hazards, software piracy cripples innovation. Developers invest considerable time and resources into creating valuable tools; when their work is stolen, it directly impacts their ability to fund future research, development, and improvements. This stagnation ultimately harms the entire tech ecosystem and limits the availability of cutting-edge solutions for everyone. Moreover, it fosters an unethical environment where intellectual property is devalued, making it harder for creators to thrive. While the allure of free software may seem appealing, the hidden costs\u2014ranging from compromised security and lost data to stunted technological advancement\u2014far outweigh any perceived short-term benefits, making it a detrimental practice for all involved.",
        "The difference between a doctor approaching a patient in comparison with nursing practice on the same subject can be an excellent topic due to the highlighted features that are emphasized when parallel. Thus, medical practice using one's physiological status while nursing also implementing psychological responses is an effective way in making the difference between the two clear while operating based on PICOT. The points to be included are the difference in the research approach. Since medical practice is more objective due to the fact that it relies on specific outcomes and facts, the research is quantitative. On the other hand, the PICOT question included in the nursing framework typically emphasizes subjective patient experiences, perceptions, and quality of life, leading to qualitative research. This approach is essential as nursing practice holistic care, focusing on the individual's psychological and social responses to health conditions. While medical research quantifies outcomes like disease remission rates or physiological markers, nursing research explores the 'how' and 'why' of patient experiences \u2013 for example, understanding coping mechanisms or the impact of support systems. This fundamental divergence in research methodology highlights the distinct yet complementary roles of physicians and nurses: doctors often focus on disease pathology and cure through measurable interventions, whereas nurses prioritize understanding and supporting the human experience of illness through empathetic, person-centered care.",
        "In general, numerous types of reasoning exist and find implementation, but not all of them bear special significance for decisions affecting patient care. Approaches to reasoning can be classified into types based on the inductive or deductive direction of inquiry, the use of analogy or abduction, the utilization of decomposition and evidence synthesis, and so on. In the healthcare field, reliance on credible evidence is what informs the professional community's approach to clinical reasoning, given that mere suggestions and excessive experimentation and creativity involve extra risks for healthcare consumers. Particularly, the so-called frequency-based reasoning dominates the field, precisely because it grounds clinical decisions in probabilities derived from vast empirical data and established epidemiological trends. This approach prioritizes what is most likely to occur or be effective based on population-level evidence, minimizing the risks associated with less predictable methods. For instance, prescribing a common antibiotic for a typical bacterial infection relies on its statistically proven efficacy and safety profile in millions of previous cases. This systematic reliance on what has frequently worked or been observed reduces diagnostic errors and treatment failures. While other reasoning types like abductive (for generating hypotheses) or analogical (for rare cases) play a role, frequency-based reasoning provides the essential, evidence-driven bedrock for routine, safe, and effective patient care, ensuring decisions are rooted in validated outcomes rather than speculation.",
        "The modern world economy is so diverse and deep that it is very difficult to predict for sure when a crisis will break. Recession is danger, and danger is stress \u2013 in such a situation, the brain begins to rely on basic instincts of protection \u2013 to run, hide, survive. Crisis intervention is a relatively new discipline, the main task of which is to provide temporary emergency emotional assistance to victims of mental and physical violence (Colford & Cavaiola, 2017). Nowadays, there is a risk of economic decline which can seriously affect the entire population; hence, I would not like to witness a major economic downturn without adequate mental health support systems in place. While governments and financial institutions focus on fiscal policies and market stability, the profound psychological impact on individuals and families often goes underappreciated. The stress of job loss, financial insecurity, and an uncertain future can trigger anxiety, depression, and even despair, mirroring the 'fight or flight' response on a societal scale. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize that crisis intervention, traditionally associated with personal trauma, has a vital role to play in economic downturns. Expanding access to mental health resources and incorporating psychological first aid into community resilience plans would not only mitigate immediate distress but also foster a more robust and compassionate societal response to the inevitable shocks of the global economy. Prioritizing human well-being alongside economic recovery is essential for true societal stability.",
        "One of the most critical factors of breast cancer development is heredity since it causes a genetically inherent disease. If the patient's closest relatives have been diagnosed with breast cancer, a tumor's likelihood is high even at a young age (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2016). Since one of the patient's close relatives had this disease, this diagnosis is indeed possible for her as well. Another significant factor in developing cancer is various diseases of the mammary glands, for example, \u201ccystic\u201d breasts. In the presence of such conditions, the formation of atypical cells **can be significantly increased, potentially escalating the risk of malignant transformation. These conditions warrant close monitoring due to their inherent proliferative nature.**\n\nBeyond these predispositions, other factors like **hormonal influences** are critical. Prolonged exposure to estrogen, whether naturally occurring through early menarche or late menopause, or exogenously via hormone replacement therapy, has been linked to increased risk. **Lifestyle choices** further impact susceptibility; obesity, excessive alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity are well-documented contributors to breast cancer development. Conversely, a healthy diet and regular exercise can offer some protection. Understanding this multifaceted etiology, which combines genetic predisposition, pre-existing conditions, and environmental factors, underscores the importance of personalized risk assessment, regular screening, and early intervention for effective management and improved patient outcomes.",
        "Students, parents, and teachers remain overloaded in today's educational system, which affects schools' efforts in building healthy relationships with the populations they serve. The categories above are heavily influenced by information overloads and the requirement to multi-task that permeates the modern educational system (Zarra, 2013). For students, it involves excessive pressure from the school system and even parents linked with remembering large amounts of subject-specific information, performing well on tests, and engaging in dissimilar activities to succeed (Zarra, 2013). The need to develop new IT and software use competencies aside from their already demanding academic workload only exacerbates this pressure. This constant influx of information and the expectation to excel across multiple domains \u2013 academics, extracurriculars, digital literacy \u2013 leaves little room for deep engagement or genuine connection. Students often feel like cogs in a machine, constantly processing and performing, rather than individuals fostering growth and relationships. This pervasive stress not only impacts their mental health but also strains their ability to connect authentically with peers, teachers, and even their own families. When every moment is dedicated to meeting an external demand, the crucial time needed for social-emotional development and relationship-building is severely diminished, hindering the very foundation of a supportive educational environment.",
        "The book, \u201cCoaching habit: Say less, ask more & change the way you lead forever\u201d, is by Stanier M. Bungay. The publication was released in 2016 through Box of Crayons Press. The author and publishers claim that they give \u201cmanagers practical tools so they can coach in ten minutes or less\u201d (Bungay, 2016, p. 1). One major argument that comes up is that silence does not mean lack of knowledge or disrespect. This element has been stressed in some chapters of the book due to the fact that a coach\u2019s ability to embrace silence is fundamental to effective coaching. Rather than signaling a lack of response or understanding from the coachee, strategic pauses provide crucial space for reflection, allowing individuals to process information, formulate their own thoughts, and arrive at independent solutions.\n\nThe book argues that managers often rush to fill silence, either by rephrasing questions, offering suggestions, or even providing answers, thereby inadvertently robbing the coachee of the opportunity for genuine insight and ownership. By resisting this urge, the coach empowers the other person to delve deeper into their own thinking, fostering self-reliance and critical problem-solving skills. This discomfort with silence, often perceived as an awkward void, is reframed as a powerful tool for growth. It encourages the coachee to take responsibility for their answers and actions, ultimately transforming their perspective and enabling lasting behavioral change.",
        "An initial reaction rate is an instant rate at the beginning of the response. The graph has the y and x-axis, y stands for the concentration of moles per liter, and x stands for time in seconds. In this case, the chemical reaction is going against time; at the beginning of the response, the chemical concentration is very high, hence considered a positive reaction. As time goes by, the slope decreases, giving a negative curve; therefore, the reactant concentration reduces within an interval of time. Instantaneous rate is an instant rate in time with differential rate, the rate at any specific moment, determined by the slope of the tangent line to the concentration-time curve at that particular point. Unlike the average rate, which considers a broader time interval, the instantaneous rate provides a precise measure of how quickly reactants are being consumed or products formed at a given instant. As the reaction proceeds, reactant concentrations decrease, leading to fewer effective collisions between reactant molecules. This reduction in collision frequency directly causes the reaction rate to slow down. Consequently, the slope of the tangent line to the concentration-time curve becomes less steep (less negative for reactants) over time, illustrating the continuous decrease in the instantaneous rate until equilibrium is reached or reactants are depleted. This dynamic change in rate highlights the dependence of reaction speed on reactant availability, a fundamental concept in chemical kinetics. Understanding both initial and instantaneous rates is crucial for elucidating reaction mechanisms and predicting reaction behavior under various conditions.",
        "A lot of historical events and time periods have specific names. The renaissance, the enlightenment, the stone age \u2013 all of these were called such for a particular reason, and signify a way to differentiate one era from another. One prime example of that trend is the industrial revolution. Also called the industrialization, it was an important part of history and a big step in both technological and social development. Happening at a never-before seen speed, the process has begun and ended in less than a 100 years. The word \u201crevolution\u201d in \u201cindustrial revolution\u201d is used to denote the profound and rapid transformation it brought about, rather than a violent political upheaval. This period, primarily from the late 18th to mid-19th century, marked an unprecedented shift from agrarian and handicraft economies to industrial and machine-manufacturing ones. Innovations like the steam engine, power loom, and spinning jenny revolutionized production, leading to the rise of factories and mass production. Cities swelled as people migrated from rural areas seeking work, creating new social structures and challenges like overcrowding, poor sanitation, and harsh labor conditions, particularly for the working class. Despite these initial hardships, the Industrial Revolution fundamentally reshaped human society, laying the groundwork for modern capitalism, global trade, and the technological advancements we rely on today, forever altering the course of human progress and setting a new pace for development.",
        "Panama is a developing country with a fast-growing economy located in Central America. It has one of the highest GDPs in Latin America but is not devoid of domestic economic problems, such as income inequality and poverty. This paper aims to review two current news articles about Panama, which reveal the issue of the high unemployment rate in this country, which continues to increase and has taken the form of a crisis. The first article appeared in a Panama news outlet called Newsroom Panama. It reports that, in 2021, 108,975 people in Panama were searching for a job, and the unemployment **rate had climbed to 9.9%, a significant jump from pre-pandemic levels, signaling a worsening labor market.**\n\n**The second article, published by Reuters in early 2022, further corroborated this trend, highlighting how the pandemic exacerbated existing structural issues.** It noted that sectors like tourism and retail, traditionally major employers, faced severe setbacks, leading to widespread job losses that have been slow to recover. Both reports underscore a concerning reality: despite economic growth, Panama struggles with creating sufficient opportunities for its workforce. This persistent high unemployment not only fuels social unrest but also hinders the nation's broader development goals, demanding urgent and comprehensive policy interventions beyond mere economic recovery.",
        "The article represents an overview of other literature on methodologies and criteria used in supplier evaluation and selection process, which is believed to be one of the vital components of a successful operation of a manufacturing company. In particular, the paper emphasized the industry's change in this field \u2013 from focusing primarily on operational efficiency to embracing the potential of strategic partnerships. The article claims that the right approach to supplier assessment, thus, is the key to a company's development and progress. The paper starts with various ways to address the issues related to MCDM of suppliers' selection. The most common ones are stated, encompassing various multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tools like Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), and sophisticated weighted scoring models. These methodologies represent a crucial evolution from simplistic cost-based evaluations, reflecting the understanding that a supplier's value extends far beyond mere price. Companies now meticulously scrutinize factors like quality management, technological capabilities, financial stability, and ethical practices, recognizing that a weak link can jeopardize the entire operation.\n\nThis strategic shift necessitates evaluating not just immediate performance but also a supplier's potential for innovation and collaborative growth. Viewing suppliers as integral partners, extending a company's own capabilities, directly impacts product development, market responsiveness, and overall brand reputation. Therefore, a robust, multi-faceted supplier selection framework is not merely good practice but an indispensable strategic investment, vital for resilience, fostering innovation, and maintaining a competitive edge in today's dynamic global marketplace.",
        "The introduction of new levels of nursing education is a major reform that has contributed to the complexity of the field. Traditionally, nursing schools provided degrees of a Bachelor's level associated with the basic skills required by this profession. However, today, aspiring nurses have access to high-quality Master's programs that further develop their competencies. In this regard, a question may reasonably arise regarding the actual value of such degrees. In fact, Master's programs in nursing are essential for healthcare, as they align with the growing importance of nurses and the contemporary view of the system. Bachelor's degrees provide students with the foundational knowledge for direct patient care, critical thinking, and ethical practice, preparing them for entry-level roles. Yet, today's complex healthcare environment necessitates deeper expertise. Master's programs cultivate advanced clinical reasoning, leadership skills, and specialized competencies crucial for roles like nurse practitioners, clinical specialists, or educators. These degrees empower nurses to manage intricate patient cases, conduct vital research, and advocate for systemic improvements. By fostering a workforce capable of innovation and advanced practice, Master's education ensures nurses can effectively address the evolving demands of public health, enhance patient outcomes, and actively shape the future of a dynamic healthcare system.",
        "The four goals of anti-bias education are forming identity, promoting diversity, teaching justice, and fostering activism. Identity formation presupposes that each child sees himself or herself as an individuum who associates himself with a certain family group. Diversity presupposes learning to respect differences between individuals and cultures. Teaching justice means teaching children to understand where wrong is done and to behave respectfully to all people (Derman-Sparks & Edwards, 2019). Activism is about educating children to be self-confident and not afraid to speak out for themselves. These goals are valuable since they allow children to develop a comprehensive understanding of themselves and the world around them. By affirming individual identities, anti-bias education builds self-esteem and a strong sense of belonging, which are crucial for healthy development. Simultaneously, fostering an appreciation for diversity equips young people with the empathy and cultural competence needed to navigate an increasingly interconnected world. Learning about justice empowers them to recognize and challenge inequities, cultivating a moral compass that guides their interactions. Finally, promoting activism instills the courage to speak up against prejudice and advocate for a fair and inclusive society. Ultimately, these interconnected goals lay the groundwork for a generation of thoughtful, compassionate, and engaged citizens committed to building a more just and equitable future for everyone.",
        "Social responsibility entails policies that organizations put in place as part of a company's governance projected to ensure the corporate's functions are effective and beneficial to all stakeholders. These guidelines help protect the environment, improve the quality of life for societies, and provide a conducive working environment through recognizing and appreciating talented and hardworking employees. This increases customer loyalty as clients feel they are helping the business support worthy initiatives, thus, enabling more access to funds and allowing more investors to join and support the company. The business rewards employees through meaningful praises, which makes them appreciated. It provides workers a chance to lead by example, fostering a culture of ethical decision-making and innovation. This empowerment extends beyond internal operations, encouraging employees to actively participate in community engagement and environmental stewardship programs. Such initiatives demonstrate a genuine commitment to societal well-being, moving beyond mere compliance to proactive contribution. Ultimately, embracing social responsibility is not just about fulfilling an ethical obligation; it's a strategic imperative that builds a resilient, reputable, and profitable organization. It creates a virtuous cycle where positive societal impact reinforces business success, attracting top talent, loyal customers, and committed investors, thereby ensuring long-term sustainability and shared prosperity for all involved.",
        "In order to be successful as an organization, its managers and employees should devote themselves to certain principles and seek to fulfill them in real life. In this regard, Fisher (2008) suggests ten principles that, in the author's opinion, should be central for any entity. Nina, the Administrator of an outpatient dialysis facility, emphasized three core business principles, namely decide who you serve, manage employees, and decide what makes you different, which helped her run the facility successfully. As for the former, deciding whom to serve is a crucial step as it determines the focus of a company's strategic focus. For Nina, this meant precisely defining her target dialysis patient group, enabling highly tailored care and optimized resource allocation. This clarity directly enhanced patient satisfaction and outcomes.\n\nSecondly, effective employee management was crucial. Nina understood her staff directly influenced patient experience; thus, investing in their training and fostering a supportive environment cultivated a dedicated, high-performing team. Engaged employees are vital for consistent quality and efficiency.\n\nFinally, establishing a unique differentiator provided a competitive advantage. Be it through superior patient experience, advanced technology, or a compassionate approach, this distinction attracted and retained clients. Nina\u2019s successful application of these core principles highlights their practical importance for an organization's prosperity.",
        "Medical institutions function to protect the interests of patients and meet their needs; they are now the object of attention of society as a whole. The population's confidence in the activities of medical organizations is an essential indicator of their effectiveness. Bringing current terminology and the nature of the relationship between patients and physicians into a state of certainty will help to understand and delineate the nature of consumerism in health care (Calnal, 2010). The absence or lack of trust is of particular concern to patients. They feel vulnerable not only because they are sick but also because of the research and treatment they have to undergo. This inherent power imbalance, coupled with the complex nature of medical decisions, necessitates an unwavering foundation of trust. Patients depend on physicians not just for expertise, but for empathy, clear communication, and a commitment to their best interests, free from perceived commercial pressures. The idea of \"consumerism\" in healthcare, while aiming to empower patients, risks reducing a complex, humanistic relationship to a mere transaction if not carefully defined. It can inadvertently breed skepticism, prompting patients to question motivations rather than fully engaging in collaborative care. Therefore, fostering an environment where ethical principles supersede purely market-driven logic is paramount. Transparent communication about treatment options, risks, and costs, alongside a renewed focus on the doctor's fiduciary duty, can rebuild and sustain the trust essential for effective, patient-centered healthcare delivery.",
        "Theodore Roosevelt was one of the youngest American presidents known for his progressive ideas and the desire to change society, addressing the existing distrust and helplessness. The decision to promote progressive ideas was not spontaneous, and he saw the movement as the possibility to protect the real rule of humans (Roosevelt, 1912). The characteristics of a progressive are the intention to stand for social justice, achieve good for all people, and improve the environment in which individuals should grow and develop. Being a progressive means being optimistic about every initiative and participating in problem-solving processes. There is no need to hide from the difficult truths of inequality or to shy away from the immense work required for societal uplift. Instead, progressives champion transparency and proactive engagement, believing that collective action can dismantle systemic barriers and foster genuine equity. Roosevelt\u2019s era, much like our own, demanded courage to confront entrenched interests and champion the welfare of the many over the privilege of the few. This philosophy underscores the vital role of government as an instrument for the common good, ensuring fair play and creating an environment where every individual has the chance to flourish. Being progressive is an enduring commitment to vigilance, innovation, and an unwavering belief in humanity\u2019s capacity to build a more just and sustainable world. It is an active, optimistic pursuit of a better future, grounded in the conviction that societal improvement is always within reach.",
        "Blockchain can be defined as a developing technology that is increasingly used in various fields of human activity. The report by Grech and Camilleri (2017) provides insight into applications of blockchain in education, which are \u201cstill in their infancy\u201d (p. 8). The authors emphasize the numerous benefits and social advantages that this concept can bring into the academic setting. Grech and Camilleri (2017) state that \u201cwithin education, activities likely to be disrupted by blockchain technology include the award of qualifications, licensing and accreditation, management of student records, intellectual property management.\"\n\nThis disruption promises to usher in an era of unprecedented transparency, security, and efficiency. For instance, blockchain\u2019s immutable ledger can transform the awarding of qualifications, making them instantly verifiable, tamper-proof, and globally accessible, significantly reducing fraud. Furthermore, managing student records could shift from fragmented institutional databases to a system where students own and control their educational data, enhancing privacy and streamlining transfers. Intellectual property management in research also benefits, with blockchain providing irrefutable timestamps for academic works, securing originality. While challenges in adoption and integration persist, blockchain\u2019s potential to create a more trustworthy, efficient, and student-centric educational ecosystem is undeniable, promising a fundamental shift in academic operations and service delivery.",
        "According to Lufkin (2021), there is an urgent need to reduce the impact on physical and digital presenteeism in the era of pandemic and social transformations. This article focuses on the importance of recognizing true motives for presenteeism and defines the impact of subconscious biases on employee relationships. At the same time, the mere exposure and halo effects are associated with unfair or ineffective promotions that determine the quality of work. The idea that many biases unreasonably support presenteeism and negatively contribute to performance is correct, and differentiating employees' achievements using favors seems questionable. This phenomenon creates a work environment where perceived effort, rather than actual output, is rewarded. Employees who consistently appear \"on\" or visible, whether physically in the office or digitally online, may inadvertently benefit from these biases, leading to promotions or recognition that are not truly earned. Such practices demoralize high-performing individuals who prioritize efficiency and results over mere presence. Ultimately, a culture that tolerates presenteeism, fueled by unexamined biases, not only stifles innovation and productivity but also risks losing valuable talent to organizations that genuinely value merit and objective performance metrics. Addressing these biases is crucial for fostering equitable and productive workplaces.",
        "The film that was watched in order to note a number of cases of violence or abuse is For colored girls. The type of abuse that will be taken from the movie refers to rape. In particular, it is the situation around Tangie, who was raped by her grandfather (Perry, 2010). Below, the assessments, implementation, and education within the scope of a care plan will be provided. Initially, it will be essential to evaluate Tangie's mental state, which can be done after a series of conversations. The latter ones should be conducted with Tangie and her closest people who can offer insights into her emotional state and behavioral changes. This assessment would identify symptoms of trauma, like PTSD or depression, and evaluate her current coping mechanisms and support system.\n\nImplementation involves immediate access to trauma-informed counseling to process the experience and develop healthy coping strategies. A medical evaluation is also essential. Crucially, ensuring a safe living environment, potentially separate from the abuser, and offering legal advocacy if desired, are vital for her safety and recovery.\n\nEducation would target both Tangie and her support network. Tangie would learn about the psychological impacts of sexual assault, validating her feelings. Her family would receive guidance on offering constructive support and understanding the recovery process. Community resources, such as support groups, would also be shared to foster sustained healing and resilience."
