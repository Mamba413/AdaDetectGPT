        "Circumstances and Encountered Issues In the case study presented, the overall setting surrounding the Asian Health Services (AHS) corporation appears to put additional pressure on the enterprise's executives. AHS is a prosperous organization that was able to process over 117,000 patient visits in 2014 and possessed seven sites in addition to three owned properties (Chung & Chin, 2015). However, with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the situation changed drastically, creating both advantages and disadvantages for AHS. Although ACA increased patient supply, the medical organization encountered a significant challenge when introducing the new uninsured clients into the system and beginning their treatment (Chung & Chin, 2015). Furthermore, under the introduced act, the quality of care had to be improved tremendously, and the pay for performance framework had to be implemented (Chung & Chin, 2015). In the long term, these challenges were overcome by establishing an electronic medical records system, focusing on patient support, and adding new services. Nonetheless, several issues remained to be addressed despite the successful changes. Currently, the organization needs to enhance its efforts in providing better care for its employees. As such, the customer services department requires more multilingual staff for efficient communication, while the chief medical officer argues that physicians and other providers need additional incentives (Chung & Chin, 2015). The medical and dental clinics were also suggested for expansion, given the increased numbers of patients (Chung & Chin, 2015). Therefore, crucial decisions are to be made if AHS is to improve its current outputs and resolve the emerging complications. Asian Health Services: Mission,",
        "One of the social factors that might impact what groceries are purchased is the lack of healthy food. Addressing Wal-Mart in Forest Part allows me to gather enough information about available products and their prices. For example, one gallon of great value milk is $2.65, one loaf of Sara Lee bread is $2.44, one bag of gala apples is $3.58, and one bag of organic baby carrots is $3.88. Continuing my visit, the prices are as follows: one yogurt container is $1.92, 2-liter of Pepsi Soda is $1.98, one bag of chips is $2.84, and one family-size pack of cookies is $3.98. In Maywood, IL 60153, the population is mostly African Americans (68.6%), but white citizens (18.2%) and Hispanic/Latino (26.9%) also live there (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). The chosen living area lacks good grocery stores, but the number of fast-food restaurants has significantly increased during the last few years. It means that people are not able to buy healthy food but have to eat poor-quality products, contributing to their health problems like hypertension and diabetes. Another social factor that affects human health and shopping habits is poor transformation and the impossibility for the working class to visit Wal-Mart regularly. The median household income in the chosen region is about $50,176, and the poverty level is about 15% (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). It means that not all individuals can go to the stores with good food and make decisions, not at the",
        "Every business must be managed carefully, and every detail must receive a fair amount of attention. When it comes to healthcare, such facilities must require even more attention because they focus on people's well-being. Performing such duties might be strenuous and expensive, and mentally demanding. As a Chief Nursing Officer, one will be faced with principles that include integrity maintenance, cash flow management, and employee motivation in the given circumstances. To start with, a healthcare business must always maintain its integrity. It can be evident that any business field should be focused on communication, which makes integrity a vital part (Fisher, 2008). In the given facility, the integrity maintenance principle is heavily adhered to. First of all, every doctor follows an ethical code, meaning that they know of doctor-patient confidentiality. Moreover, doctors and nurses focus on honest communication with patients. For example, in my situation, I tell patients about their actual conditions and honestly answer their questions. Another important business principle is proper cash flow management. Healthcare facility requires renovations",
        "Different circumstances under which medical staff has worked led to varying types of leadership strategies being developed. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the role of clear communication and the handling of prompt preparation in top healthcare leaders (Nicola et al., 2020). Another key tactic includes the use of external change agents that ultimately promote excellent organizational decision-making (Alagoz et al., 2018). Moreover, one study explained how implementing positivity-related and open-minded approaches as leaders can improve their employee's resilience, providing an additional source of motivation (Wei et al., 2018). Hence, effective healthcare leaders must adapt to various external changes and strategically communicate with their coworkers. Several departments can be interacted with through the role of a healthcare administrator. One of them includes the in-patient department where multiple approaches from skilled professionals are needed. Moreover, critical care and A&E require excellent management and collaborating opportunities. As already mentioned, the selected healthcare areas are prime examples of fields requiring strong leaders to",
        "Creating a legal definition for various ages is crucial for lawmakers in America. By establishing the boundaries between childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, it becomes possible to clarify the specifics of such periods and behaviors that the individuals might demonstrate. However, as explained by Scott (2000) in The Legal Construction of Adolescence, there are several complications connected to clearly defining the end of childhood and the overall period of adolescence. While childhood and adulthood ages can be specified by distinguishing between the children's vulnerability and adults' responsibility, adolescent populations' ages are more difficult to determine due to the transitional nature of this growth period. In the contemporary legal framework, adolescence is not properly defined. Nevertheless, it appears that not including this term in the system is a highly successful tactic that allows the policymakers to avoid additional confusion that is connected to the introduction of a new concept. As such, the categorical approach is most commonly used when managing cases of adolescents, thus relying on the",
        "Retailers, Wholesalers and Manufacturers are three stakeholder groups that can greatly contribute to financial success or failure of a business. All three of them are involved in the supply chains of most middle and large-scale product-oriented businesses. The three groups have certain aspects in common but are drastically different in how they engage with a firm's products and its customers. The differences apply to the amounts of goods a group is dealing with as part of its function, as well as its direct role in the chain. Retailers earn money by acquiring things in bulk at a discount from wholesalers and reselling them for a profit. They seek to shift such things across as quickly as possible in order to reduce inventory holding expenses. They, however, then resell the items on a comparatively small scale and don't facilitate bulk-buying. Out of the three groups, retailers are the most consumer-oriented, and offer direct customer service to those who attend them to buy products from multiple brands. Wholesalers acquire items in",
        "The Spirit bear of the British Colony is a unique species of bears that amaze with their appearance and are of particular importance to the population of British Columbia. This type of animal is a kind of Kermode bear and is a subspecies of black bears, which often have dark fur (Service, 2017). However, due to a genetic mutation, some of the representatives of spirit bears have a white coat color, which is why they have such an interesting name (Langlois, 2017). Like many representatives of this species, they weigh an average of two hundred kilograms (Service, 2017). Many sources note the extreme rarity of this type of bear and only estimated about four hundred species in British Columbia, which determines the need to preserve them (Groc, n.d.). Moreover, it is believed that they are closely related to the indigenous population of America, as they contribute to the development of the ecosystem in which",
        "Communication and collaboration are crucial elements for the success of any individual and team effort. The first chapter of the book Technical Communication provides insight into the aspects of technical communication and its importance. I discovered that technical communication addresses two main tasks: assisting people in learning about certain phenomena or how to do a certain task. Additionally, technical communication can make others strengthen their attitudes, change them, or even take particular actions. I also found that technical documents reflect organizational culture, are made in collaboration and have distinctive elements, including a particular reader, clear instructions on resolving an issue, design, images, and words. Finally, I discovered that technical communication was a valuable skill in the workplace since it allows people to read and produce technical documents. When collaborating with my colleagues and other students, I have had many different experiences. The negative collaboration experience concerned the lack of willingness of certain members of the team to contribute to the joint work (Markel & Selber, 2021). These people did not share their ideas",
        "The European powers had taken major parts of the world, including the Caribbean. In the 15 th century, the Europeans claimed the region following the establishment of Spanish settlements and conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires (Horne, 2018). Due to the conquest, it was easy for the Spanish to invade Mexico and Peru through exploration in strategic points of the Caribbean region. Following the Spanish invasion of the Caribbean in the 17th century, other European powers such as the British and French started settling in pivotal points such as the island of Tortuga and later moved to Jamaica (Horne, 2018). By mid-century, many non-Hispanic privateers had established permanent colonies and trading zones in Caribbean islands. The profitability in terms of wealth enabled rise of conquest to Caribbean region. First, it was easy to obtain gold, which was among the region's key aspects of the scramble. The existence of Christopher Columbus in the region had shown the way for other leaders to set colonies (Horne, 2018). Second, there was the availability of a labor force drawn from the African continent as black people were used as slaves to work in the industrial openings in the area. Due to the decline of Spanish power in the region, majorly as a result of reduced native population of the area, the other European powers boosted their presence in areas that Columbus had covered. For example, Francis Drake, a privateer from England, attacked many Spanish settlements (Horne, 2018). The collaborative base between the French, British and Dutch made it possible for European powers to conquer the",
        "It is clear to modern people, as well as many people who lived in the 1930s, that the Second World War was inevitable. Some believe that the United States of America could prevent the outbreak of the war. However, this could hardly be possible due to several reasons. The American government maintained an isolationist foreign policy in the 1930s. The period was challenging as all countries had to address severe economic issues (Corbett et al., 2021). Americans wanted to concentrate on domestic matters, including a threatening spread of communist ideas (Russett, 2019). It is noteworthy that the USA could hardly interfere and have a considerable impact on European affairs due to the country's comparatively low economic might. The United States was not a financial leader at that period, so its influence was limited. Moreover, the USA alone could not prevent the world war because it was outbroken as a result of the clash between European",
        "In order to better understand the higher prevalence of diabetes within the county, it is essential to observe both national and local trends of the illness. According to the CDC (2022), while new cases of diabetes have steadily decreased over the decades, the prevalence of the disease among people aged below twenty has not. Similarly, the prevention and management of diabetes among older adults is largely unsatisfactory and could be vastly improved. A number of socio-cultural factors also influence the prevalence of diabetes. For instance, individuals with Hispanic backgrounds are more prone to have the condition. Other factors such as age, smoking, physical inactivity, and obesity among residents could also be impacting the prominence of diabetes. Within the setting of the county, it is likely that age, elevated hypertension, and Hispanic backgrounds are the main risk factors for residents. While age and increased blood pressure are more common risks for type 2 diabetes, the Hispanic background component may be a more recent development that is influenced by a number of social factors (National",
        "There is a growing number of physicians' encounters with the victims of human trafficking, sometimes even without recognizing them as such. Recently, Todres (2017) reported an incident, where Dr. W was requested to screen the women-employees of such a firm for sexually transmitted infections. On the one hand, according to the Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association (2011), it is necessary to safeguard patient confidentiality, including several aspects, such as physical, informational, decisional, and associational privacy. At the same time, it is obligatory to keep the records of all the patients in the healthcare settings while Dr. W was asked not to maintain them to avoid possible arrest of these women. Thus, the doctor understood that in another case, the employees of this firm would not have a chance for diligent healthcare and, moreover, could possibly spread the STIs further. The case engages issues in several fields, such as criminal law, ethical concerns, human rights, and service provider",
        "The foundation myths of Rome represent some of the qualities vital for a successful state in antiquity \u2013 decisiveness, militancy, and political and social flexibility. Historians of different sorts have been trying to understand and interpret the story of Romulus and Remus since its creation. The following stages of Rome's supposed history also raise many questions regarding fratricide, abduction, rape, and also the backgrounds of Rome's first citizens. The fact that according to most of the myths, Rome started from fratricide seems to be quite relevant as the city's history is famously filled with civil conflicts and wars. Many historians tried to sugarcoat this episode \u2013 Cicero ignored it, Dionysius of Halicarnassus depicted Romulus as full of regret, and Egnatius suggested that Remus had survived and outlived Romulus (as cited in Beard, 2015). Another Roman historian \u2013 Livy \u2013 told the story of Romulus reacting to his brother's actions, therefore, portraying the city's founder as a hard, bellicose,",
        "Portraying the lives of gods and depicting relationships between them, as well as their interactions with humans, both \u201cIliad\u201d and \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d elaborate on the theme of power abuse by those at the helm. In \u201cIliad,\u201d Agamemnon has to face retribution due to his constant abuse of power: \u201cbe ready, that I be not left,/Alone of all the Greeks, without my prize\u201d (Homer, 762 B. C.). Likewise, in \u201cMetamorphosis,\u201d various deities display complete disrespect for those of lesser power: \u201cWhat had escaped the waves, now feared the flame\u201d (Ovid, 8 B.C.). However, unlike the \u201cIliad,\u201d \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d rarely demonstrates the comeuppance that deities have to face for their negligence of mortals' needs (Homer, 762 B. C.; Ovid, 8 B. C.). Therefore, while thematically similar, \u201cIliad\u201d and \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d represent slightly different perspectives on the problem o power abuse. The theme",
        "The rate of patient mortality in intensive care is a growing concern for medical practitioners. Although the cause of patient motility may be attributed to many factors even before the individual reaches the CCU, it has been reported that an effective tube placement during resuscitation aids healthy circulation. It is not known if the nurse's knowledge of capnography affects its use in critical care units. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the relationship between nurses' knowledge of capnography and its use in coronary care units. The project will provide valuable insight into factors affecting the use of capnography, thus contributing to the field and filling the gap in the literature. The intervention protocol will train nurses on the benefit of capnography and test their implementation in critical care units. Based on the training and testing, the goal is to facilitate the implementation of capnography use in the selected CCU. The intervention will also enable accurate tube placement to stimulate normal chest circulation during resuscitation, improve quality care delivery, and patient recovery in critical care units. The project will recruit nurses working in the selected coronary care unit in Central Jersey. This setting was chosen because of the high incidence of nurse's refusal to use capnography during resuscitation. The project timeline is twenty-four weeks. The selected participants will be based on the inclusion criteria, and their test results will be confidential and used solely for testing nursing knowledge of capnography. This project will facilitate positive health outcomes by providing evidence to support nursing practice in implementing capnography during resuscitation.",
        "The phrase that caught me most from the video is from Isaiah, stating that Samuel has taught him that one person can play t-ball and hit it hard when sitting down. This is a powerful statement indicating that people can be prejudiced despite having good intentions. Samuel's family did not realize the struggles disabled people go through before he was born (PinehurstPictures, 2010). The child's image hitting the t-ball also showcased a powerful issue, that disabled individuals should be treated similarly to other people and given equal opportunities to give them the chance to perform optimally. I was intrigued to see children like Nathanial Orellana learning in a normal classroom. His mother determined they sought school actively to ensure he received the best care considering his autism (PinehurstPictures, 2010). Parents face a myriad of extra challenges raising disabled children to give them advantages that would help them compete with their peers in society. The video illustrates that communities and the government should provide parents with a variety of schools to determine the best for their child's disability. Children with disabilities require special care but should be allowed to interact with others if their illness would not worsen based on these connections. Engagement is a crucial tool for child development as it requires them to be attentive and active, propagating greater achievement due to increased enthusiasm. Nathanial raises his hand to answer a question because each student is engaged in the classroom. His enthusiasm to answer the question shows interest and a desire to learn, traits associated with high achievement. The video is helpful because it provides a glimpse of the life individuals",
        "Slavery has been one of the most problematic aspects of the history of humankind. Slavery developed as European trading and marine settlements which required additional labor in the American colonies (Harris, 2018). Settlers comprised enslaved people from Native Americans and forcibly brought Africans, using slave labor in every part of the economy, from sugar production to harvesting and exploration of raw materials (Harris, 2018). The practice of slavery in British North America can be characterized by how colonists regarded enslaved people. As slavery gradually spread across America, each area had distinctions. For instance, Jamestown in Virginia became the first permanent British settlement through which enslaved Africans were brought to North America (Harris, 2018). Similar to Jamestown, other port cities practiced slavery primarily by connecting the international slave trade with rural and urban slave markets (Harris, 2018). Slavery practices were perceived to extend in Boston, which is believed to be the first place where someone tried to force enslaved",
        "A Western scholarship has distorted the long history of African culture for centuries, and many of its basic principles have been viewed through the lens of colonization. As a result, the ideas and tenets of African philosophy have been appropriated and changed in value from the inherent parts of people's nature into commodities. In their works, p'Bitek and Marimba discuss such concepts as culture, spirituality, and philosophy of African nations and how Western ideology has reshaped their presentation without fully understanding their meaning. The commodification of African culture and the imposition of European views on the distinction between culture and philosophy, religion and spirituality have disrupted African people's ability to self-identify. The ideas by scholars show that African culture does not distinguish itself from philosophy or drive a line between reality and the spiritual nature of one's being. European culture is presented as pragmatical and commodifying \u2013 it turns pieces of life that are meant to be used into objects for observation. p'Bitek writes that culture turns from",

        "The global pandemic caused by the COVID-19 has led to severe issues in the labor market. To be more particular, the number of unemployed individuals is considerably higher than prior to the global lockdown (The Economist, para. 2). Naturally, such a situation happened due to businesses going bankrupt or reducing the number of employees to survive the economic crisis. The Economist elaborates on the statistics of the unemployment rate and shares the amount of time it can take for the labor market to recover to its prior-pandemic state (para. 1-3). This issue is complex, so McConnell et al. cover the primary aspects that contribute to it in chapters 12, 15, and 18. The 12th chapter reveals the governmental response to the labor market and how it is regulated during a crisis or similar circumstances (McConnell et al.). The 15th part indicates the detail of job hunting, which is relevant to the topic, considering that people failed to land a job because",
        "Economic globalization is an inevitable process due to many reasons, but many people argue that it has a detrimental effect on the development of many countries or even the entire world. Nevertheless, globalization positively influences the evolution of human society at large, although some adverse effects are apparent (Wade, 2004). First, it is essential to understand the benefits of economic globalization to embrace it rather than try to oppose it. Undoubtedly, economic globalization enables people to trade more efficiently and effectively as they have access to diverse resources and markets. An entrepreneur in every part of the world can offer products and services to people from other continents with the help of technology. The abundance of ideas contributes to the creation of new products making people's lives more comfortable (Sen, 2012). Individuals, companies, and countries can collaborate to conduct complex projects. However, such aspects as inequality are often raised in relation to economic globalization. It is argued that globalization is a manifestation of western imperialism as rich countries exploit the resources of developing countries (Sen, 2012). As a result, the opponents of globalization argue poor countries become even poorer. However, it is found that globalization is not directly linked to poverty and equality (Wade, 2004). Poor countries' governments' inability to cope with corruption and the lack of flexibility to adapt to new technological and cultural realms leads to inequality. Moreover, Sen (2012) stresses that emerging countries can and will also benefit from economic globalization if specific measures are undertaken. Thus, technologically advanced countries must be responsible in terms of using resources (supplied by developing countries), and developing countries must be committed to change and social",
        "The \u201cEye of the Storm\u201d video is a fascinating example of how race can be socially constructed in the classroom. Jane Elliott created a distinction between blue-eyed and brown-eyed children, teaching the young participants that their peers with brown eyes were superior (Bloom). Although this contrast does not possess any inherent meaning and is merely a representation of one's amount of melanin in the body, it became significant for the children. Thus, Elliott socially constructed race by suggesting that one group of children is better than the other, with the eye colors serving as symbols to emphasize race and group belonging. As a result of such distinction, differences in the students' activities and performance became evident. Elliott observed that the children who were in the brown-eyed group grew more confident, and they began to behave more condescendingly towards their blue-eyed peers. Contrastingly, the latter students have been reported to become more shy and timid, supposedly intimidated by the pressure from the other group (Bloom). Blue-eyed children felt less reassured, with their",
        "The differences between the Persian and Greek cultures can be seen in several traditions and customs. In Persia, the distinction between different religions and languages was accepted by the society, allowing people from the conquered territories to continue practicing their ancestral traditions without being persecuted (Brooks, 2019). In contrast, Greeks were less tolerant of other religions and cultures, enforcing submission to Greek customs from the populations residing in their territory (Brooks, 2019). Another significant dissimilarity was the citizens' attitude toward the authority, with the Persian residents voluntarily supporting the King and remaining strongly loyal to him (Brooks, 2019). In Greece, where the democratic rule was considered the most beneficial, the concept of one person reigning over others was disapproved, with the majority of the elite supporting democracy as a just distribution of power. The political structures of Persia and Greece were also highly distinct, as each system was to support the established governing methods.",
        "The main difference with regard to various gender theories is how they explain the gendered differences in behaviors characteristic for both sexes. When applied to the issue of behavioral problems in males, different theories find their causes in different sources. Biological determinism would explain behavioral issues in male students through the concept of male nature as inherently and naturally competitive, aggressive, and even violent (Tilling, 2013). However, this essentialist theory is at odds with the now well-established understanding that, while some people are predisposed toward delinquency, social influences are a far more prominent cause thereof (Delcea et al., 2019). In contrast to biological determinism, the social construction of gender theory posits that people enact gendered behaviors as they learn them from others and internalize gender norms dominant in their cultures (Tilling, 2013). This approach would explain the correlation between the male sex and behavioral problems through Western cultures' promotion of aggressive notions of masculinity, going as far as to encourage bullying (Rosen and",
        "Diana Kendall claims the current perception of the class has been a construct of the media and based on the construction, the meaning of class is determined. Kendall argues that the media has legitimized inequality in the United States through the assumption, with television programs and newspaper articles creating and reifying class-based stereotypes. Furthermore, Kendall argues that class discussions in the media are rarely explicit; however, their portrayals generate perspectives that impact human behavior. The upper class in society is portrayed positively, while the lower class is framed negatively. On the one hand, the upper class contains individuals that should be emulated, comprised of caring and generous people, and those with criminal records have remarkably good lives (Kendall 10). On the other hand, the lower class is framed as homeless, poor, largely ignored by the media, and often discussed as abstract statistics. As such, when casting a human face, the demographics of the poor determine how they are framed. The quality of life may deteriorate from the",
        "Terrorism is one of the main problems faced by humanity in the 21st century and, despite considerable countermeasures, it remains topical. Islamic terrorism is one of the most prominent forms of the radicalism of the past decades, which manifested itself in several tragic events. The movement began when Osama Bin Laden formed al Qaeda in 1989, which conducted its first attack in Yemen by placing a bomb in a hotel housing American troops (\u201cOsama bin Laden,\u201d 2020). Osama Bin Laden espoused the idea of worldwide Jihad, a holy war of Muslims against the infidels and especially the United States. The main terrorist attack of al Qaeda was the 9/11 Bombing of the World Trade Centers, claiming the lives of thousands of people and leading to the beginning of the War on Terror (\u201cOsama bin Laden,\u201d 2020). Eventually, the United States Military located Osama bin Laden and killed him, yet it did not stop other Islamic radicals from carrying out attacks. One of them was the",
        "A trade secret is one of the most valuable components of a company's functioning, which can provide it with a significant competitive advantage. Hence, it consists in confidential information that describes the processes or things that characterize the organization. It can be a phrase, a slogan, a symbol, or a mixture of these aspects. To qualify for a trademark, the information must correspond to specific points. It must have commercial value for the company, must be known to a limited number of people, and fall under such documents as consent to conceal data for the persons by whom it is used. Unlike a trademark, a trade secret is characterized by large scales. The first concept includes the protection of the name, logo, packaging of a product or service under a trademark. A trade secret as an intellectual property includes such concepts as patent, copyright, and trademarks (Andreicovici, 2021). The unauthorized acquisition, use, or disclosure of such secret information in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices by others is regarded as an unfair practice and",
        "Commitment to health theory is a special model designed to determine the stages of development and behavior changes. This theory assumes the development of an internal state, as well as the acceptance of the desire to lead a healthy lifestyle under the conditions that any circumstances may limit a person. Moreover, with the help of this theory, the necessary level is determined, which indicates a particular stage of human health (Kelly, 2014). In addition, this theory assumes that there are no established differences, such as gender, race, and others, in order to build behavior aimed at developing a healthy lifestyle. In her research, Kelly (2008) uses the principles of the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change. First of all, this is done in order to demonstrate certain stages of the change process. Furthermore, the model used sets specific requirements for health. Thus, the Commitment to Health Theory uses such principles as stages of change, decisive balance, and self-efficiency (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997). In this way, Kelly uses essential principles of this theory; thus, they are interrelated. Concerning advanced nursing practice, this theory can be used as a measurement of some patient indicators. Thus, this model will help determine the goals necessary for the patient to instill the desire to lead a healthy lifestyle. In practice, this theory will also help track the process of change and how to behave with the patient (Kelly, 2008). For example, at the first stage, the task is to instill confidence, as well as to indicate the importance of the necessary changes. At the second stage, strategies are already being applied to strengthen the patient's desire to improve the overall state of health. The third",
        "The article of Zulaika (2022) presents the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on adolescent pregnancy and school dropout among secondary school girls in Kenya. The cases of teenage pregnancy started in Kenya after the country-wide school closure that started from March 2020 and lasted until January 2021. Zulaika (2022) examine to what extent the pandemic affected sexual and reproductive health of adolescents in Rarieda subcounty. The study shows there was a limited involvement of health administrators on the issue of pregnancy among school girls. Teenagers lack sexual education and are not aware of different methods of protection. Health administrators should find this issue important as early pregnancy can be dangerous for girls' health and lead to various socio-economic problems in the future. Moreover, if such a rate of adolescent pregnancy continues to increase, there would be less educated females in Kenya. Zulaika (2022) also mentions that stress level of pregnant teenagers is high, affecting mental as well as physical health of young future mothers. To",
        "The adjustment process of new children and their parents can be challenging for them and the teacher. An educator can implement many educational and communicational techniques to ease the process and support the children and parents. I believe that maintaining constant communication with parents through conferences or phone calls, with the consideration of their time and privacy, is one of the most important elements. Encouraging home learning activities and welcoming parents into the classroom is also crucial. Most parents would like to be involved in or informed about their children's adjustment in a new classroom. Gaining parents' trust by properly communicating with them and engaging them in collaborative problem-solving and planning would ease their and their children's adjustment process (Kuhn et al., 2017). Being mindful of their time and privacy is crucial in establishing a healthy parent-educator relationship. According to Lin et al. (2019), home learning activities can help children overcome their school involvement issues. Informing parents about the importance of home-based activities would encourage them to participate, resulting in parental support and involvement in the adjustment process of the children. For parents and children with separation anxiety, an educator can invite the parents into the classroom. However, it is vital to communicate the expectations and roles to the parents beforehand to avoid misunderstandings (Zurcher, 2016). Overall, it would calm the children and reassure the parents of their children's safety during the adjustment process. The adjustment process of children and parents to a new classroom and teacher is challenging; however, there are ways to make it easier for all the parties. I think that being respectful and maintaining educator-parent communication is the most important factor in",
        "Both lookism and extreme body modification are inherently linked to unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standards of modern society. This trait aside, however, the two are very different in its manifestations and direct consequences. Lookism is merely the act of considering someone whose appearance is not what most people would regard to be beautiful. It focuses on exhibiting negative judgement to people that do not fit the standard and is thus oriented outside of the person who engages in it. Extreme body modification is the act of changing one's body in order to look in a way that deviates from the norms that society sets on appearance (Good, 2016). To contrast these two, one does not look pleasing in appearance, while the other intentionally marks oneself in ways that others would perceive as deviances or outside of societal standards. The differences between the two stem from their external or internal angles, despite both being related to the dissatisfaction with appearance. It is likely that a person who engages in lookism is deeply insecure",
        "Frankenstein possesses both positive and negative traits that help readers build his character. The main hero can be looked at from diverse perspectives; therefore, the creation of Frankenstein's character can be seen as believable or even sympathetic. Due to his life difficulties, such as losing many of his family members or friends, Frankenstein is generally pitied by the majority of the audience. Later, the reader can understand that the main hero feels quite lonely and pays much attention to his research and studies to cover this inner loneliness caused by the loss of his beloved ones. Despite several inappropriate or sometimes immoral actions performed by Viktor Frankenstein, the readers have a tendency to consider his character quite sympathetic because of his traumatic past and lonely present. Additionally, the hero's character is even taken for attractive because Frankenstein possesses several positive traits such as improving his mind by constant reading, observing the surrounding nature, and being interested in many research fields (Bowta & Puhulawa, 2018). Because of these habits, the character is quite believable",
        "While the situation with the COVID-19 pandemic is critical, the case with mandatory vaccination at work is controversial. I think it is justified because it helps stop the pandemic; those unwilling to vaccinate should be ensured that they will not facilitate the contamination by the coronavirus. However, such a decision requires additional measures to ensure that the vaccine is safe and beneficial for the human organism. Despite a lack of time, as the pandemic must be conquered as soon as possible, the laws which require massive mandatory vaccination, under a threat of high fines, are the radical measure. They should be implemented carefully, as they may limit human rights and even be undemocratic, despite sometimes they are necessary to cope with challenging situations. In my opinion, the pandemic is such a situation, and it should be overcome. I think that mandatory vaccination does not violate the bill of rights only when everyone vaccinated knows clearly what they will obtain during the vaccination. In that way, the vaccine should be tested, and all test",
        "It should be noted that there is a multitude of motivational factors to consider for a manager from both personal and organizational standpoints. In the case of the former, these include personal investment, personal growth, recognition, and achievement. On the organizational level, equity plays a critical role in impacting motivation since if there is a perception of inequity, then the disadvantaged workers will lose motivation. Dan Pink claims that there are also critically important and effective intrinsic motivators, such as autonomy, mastery, and purpose (TED, 2009). In addition, there are extrinsic motivational factors, such as rewards, pay, and bonuses. The core motivational techniques, which have been used for the majority of management's existence as a practice, include reward-based systems, such as positive and negative reinforcements and punishments. However, the recent findings in the field of motivation reveal that for most employees, it is better to provide more autonomy, such as Fedex days, ROWE, or 20% Google systems (TED, 2009). I fall into the category of autonomy",
        "The choice of ship is connected with the running costs of transportation. Stopford (2009) claims that the best way to reduce costs is to select newer ships, which require fewer crewmembers, less maintenance, and are more reliable. While all of these points are true, they do not automatically make newer ships the preferable choice for shipping costs. As it stands, 65% of all cargo ships in the world are over 14 years old, meaning that competition for newer ships is intense (Cheng, 2021). High demand means increased costs, which was demonstrated by the increase in cargo rates in 2021, and previously in 2016 (Cheng, 2021). Both of these surges saw a rise in demand for older ship services. As a rule, the offered costs of shipping by older vessels are cheaper. The reasons for that are the lower costs of purchasing a ship, which means lower pressure to repay the interest in time (Ros Chaos et al., 2021). In addition, companies running",
        "Goals and objectives outline desired outcomes and, thus, are often used interchangeably. However, the effect, timeframe, and specificity of the two terms set them apart. Nickels et al. (2019) define goals as broad and long-term outcomes that an organization seeks, while objectives define the measurable, specific, and short-term strategies for attaining the identified goal. For example, the criminal justice system uses goals to task the police, correctional agencies, and the court with the strategy to execute, including deterrence, rehabilitation, retribution, restoration, and incapacitation. Therefore, the criminal justice system particularly addresses criminal behavior with the objective of protecting people's rights. In an era of rapid change, diversity, and complexity, leadership and management are critical to the survival of any agency. Besides, the ability to lead and manage strongly permeates every aspect of the criminal justice system. While leaders guide the change through a vision, managers implement coordinated processes and structures to pursue organizational goals and objectives",
        "Environment-friendly technologies develop with the growing social awareness about the issues caused by pesticides utilization in various industries. Sharma et al. (2020) claim that \u201cthese chemicals enter the ecosystem, thus hampering the sensitive environmental equilibrium through bio-accumulation\u201d (p. 110812). Consequently, alternative strategies become in demand for protecting the plants and species from biomagnification and severe changes in natural settings (Sharma et al., 2020). Biological, semi-chemical, and physical control methods for decreasing the use of pesticides require proper encouragement to achieve sustainable improvement in the ecological situation. Indeed, the governmental programs, legislative changes, and business initiatives that promote environmental protection are the key for the novelties' implementation. There are several ways to influence the decision-making processes of pesticides used in the industries such as farming and livestock. Firstly, the awareness about the hazardous effect on human organisms must be increased through public health programs or social events. Knowledge about the diseases their pesticides",
        "Motivation is the process whereby an individual's endeavors are stimulated, guided, and maintained toward achieving a goal. Thus, the responsibility of management is to monitor and direct workers in a company (Usmonovich, 2021). This is required since it is a method of inducing individuals to work, which they are capable and equipped to do freely. Even though most people have to work for a livelihood and a job is an essential part of everyone's lives, administrators must be apprehensive about employee motivation concerns for various reasons. Managers have several valid reasons to be concerned about motivating employees. Firstly, individual success in a company is viewed as a product of talent and inspiration. Additionally, the ability is influenced by education, expertise, and learning, and its development is a difficult and laborious process, whereas motivation may be accelerated (Usmonovich, 2021). Thus, employee motivation is widely recognized as critical to a corporation's success. In addition, a business that struggles with staff motivation is more likely to experience lower output, defective manufacturing, or",
        "Feminist ethics is founded on the views that women's subordination is morally inappropriate and that women's moral experiences are as valuable as men's. Vaughn (2019) states that the following are the practical aims of feminist ethics. Firstly, feminist ethics express moral critiques of behaviors and attitudes that reinforce women's rights. Consequently, the vital goal is to provide morally reasonable means to oppose such behaviors and practices. Ultimately, feminist ethics' objective is to imagine a morally good alternative that promotes female empowerment. Feminist ethical argument resurfaced in the late 1960s, first among the general public and then in academic discourse, as part of a broader rebirth of feminist ethical questions. On issues like abortion, fairness and equality, domestic work, sexual violence, and obligatory heterosexuality, the first academic feminist ideas were expressed. Nonetheless, the term \u2018feminist ethics' did not become widely used until the late 1970s or early 1980s (Vaughn, 2019). Traditional ethics, feminists speculated, was more thoroughly male-biased and required more radical reconsideration. Moreover, feminism is continuously engaged in ethical thought and discussion. According to Vaughn (2019), feminism is primarily a normative viewpoint, and feminists themselves regularly challenge its meaning. Lack of care for women's interests, disregard for women's concerns, rejection of women's moral agency, devaluation of feminine ideals, and depreciation of women's experience are all manifestations of feminist obstacles. Putting women's interests first, considering women as ethical experts or authorities, exchanging male for female values, or extrapolating directly from women's moral experience are all illustrations of how feminist ethics has been stereotyped and viewed. Essentially, these stereotypes are widespread and inaccurate; feminist ethics is significantly more extensive",
        "The concept of culture is a fundamental phenomenon influencing all spheres of human life. It influences people's actions, methods, and approaches toward specific tasks and daily interactions. Thus, Roseberry determines culture as a socially constructed and socially constitutive part of the context where all activities take place. It means that all other fundamental institutions and phenomena, such as power, economy, and history, comprise the culture. At the same time, being the way of life, it influences the mentioned spheres and preconditions for the emergence of critical processes in these domains. In other words, peculiarities of culture influence decision-making in political processes and historical events which took place at different stages of society's evolution. Furthermore, the approaches to business in particular, and economy in general, depend on the values and visions peculiar to a bearer of a particular culture. For this reason, by understanding history and politics, it is possible to understand this unique notion and its layers. Rosebery also assumes that culture is socially constituted, meaning that many cultures",
        "In the modern world, diverse communities exist that support families in situations of emergency or need. Such support should be granted as sometimes families cannot manage their problems alone. Many communities provide families with support in diverse areas such as foster care, early childhood care, education, and homeless services (Fuss et al., 2021). For example, during the pandemics of COVID-19 many families experienced financial problems due to the ubiquitous job loss. Many such families could not cover their medical costs or even afford to buy normal food. Several organizations help families by caring about their young children or teenagers, providing them with psychological and economic help (Liebenberg et al., 2020). In such situations, to heighten or support the living standard and living conditions, communities can help families by providing them with food, accommodation, financial help, or help them find jobs. In addition, online communities can be supportive and useful for many families. For example, in situations of grief, people can support each other online or offline; however, grief support will",
        "Social media has become an integral part of the modern world, considering that many people opt to use these platforms to interact with others. Personally, I prefer to use Facebook as it is not flooded with spam and advertisement as much as Instagram, Tik Tok, or similar apps. I use Facebook to interact with my old friends, who I can no longer see because they moved to other cities or even countries, so this social platform seems a perfect option to interact with them from time to time. However, mainstream social media applications appear to have influenced today's society since people are constantly exposed to hate, negative comments or publications, and fake influencers. To elaborate, impression management theory has become real since people try to become their better selves just to make a good impression on people they meet online. This fake image on social media can harm a person's self-esteem as people may feel insecure compared to the influencers' or supermodels' content on social platforms. Goffman's theory on social exchange is also apparent in the modern world, considering that people tend to quickly end relationships with people that seem to be of no benefit to them (Barbalet, 2020). Based on the aforementioned concepts, it is apparent that social media nowadays is entirely fake and toxic to users since it worsens their mental health and self-esteem. However, the abundance of social media platforms presents numerous options for users because every application is used for different purposes. For instance, Tik Tok is mainly used to exchange funny videos with friends, while Twitter is a public diary where one can present opinions on crucial topics or not so",
        "The airline industry has been hit particularly hard by Covid 19. The virus outbreak has caused the governments of most countries to implement restrictions on traveling (Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aviation, 2022). Thus, the regulatory implementations have negatively affected the standard revenue, business practices, and practices of airline companies. First, passengers were less keen to travel due to the testing regulations, limited resources, and the lack of need to travel for work. Another cause was the regulation themselves that implied a reduction in Covid-19 cases through quarantine measures. The low demand has caused the airlines to lose revenue ($372 bn), which was an unprecedented change in the industry (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021). Flights were being canceled, and employees were laid off due to the challenging situation in which the corporations could not sustain airports with such a low passenger rate. The airline companies have experienced major economic challenges that have been facilitated by all the negative implications of the pandemic on civil aviation. As a result, fewer seats were being offered (-50%), and fewer passengers were able to travel via plane (-2,7 bn) (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021). The effect was slightly balanced out due to the fact that cargo flights have been less impacted or even increased in rates due to the transportation of medical supplies (Ni\u017eeti\u0107, 2020, p. 10953). However, as vaccines became available and fewer restrictions were put in place, the situation has changed for the better in 2021. More opportunities have occurred due to the less rigid regulatory implementations, vaccination,",
        "There are multiple factors that stand behind the successful implementation of the P-O-L-C framework. It is important to prioritize some of them duly in case a company faces serious issues, or when the market indicates upcoming challenges. The collapse of WorldCom in 2002, that led to one of the largest accounting scandals in the US, provides a nice example of the lack of proper communication in a corporation. The inability of various top managers and accountants to communicate efficiently in order to prevent frauds is always disastrous. WorldCom grew rapidly under Bernard Ebbers who managed to jump at the multiple opportunities that the growing interest for telecom services provided at that time. Nevertheless, the company went bankrupt in a matter of a few years. Moreover, Ebbers faced several charges, including one count of conspiracy, one count of securities fraud and seven counts of filing false statements with securities regulators. The fact that the large portion of Ebber's wealth was in WorldCom stocks, let",

President of Indonesia Suharto invited the leaders from developing countries to Bandung, leading to a declaration on anti-imperialism and peaceful coexistence. It was hoped to unite emerging nations through collaboration in reducing their reliance on Europe and America. The conference aimed to promote Afro-Asian economic cultural cooperation and reject neocolonialism. The fundamental principles of the meeting were to respect territorial integrity and sovereignty, refrain from the use of power, have peaceful ways of settling disputes, and non-interference among the states. This nonaligned movement was founded to keep members from taking a side in Cold War politics, creating a solid rebellion. The outcome of the Bandung conference was that most of the Southeast Asian nations joined the agreement leading to the end of the Cold War. In addition, the Afro-Asian countries gained the opportunity to have a voice in world affairs, such as the representation of the Global",

Heung notes that it is a story about imitation and pretending to be untrue. Lora Meredith, a white woman, widow, and aspiring actress, always pretends. The motive for this behavior is to avoid the hassle of raising his only daughter, Susie, alone with very little money. Although Lora defies stereotypes by not letting any man control her or interfere with her success, she upholds the proper standards of a good mother. In turn, Susie's imitation of life is how she pretends to be a daughter, receiving all the love and affection from someone other than her mother while at the same time desperately showing her love to a man whose love is unrequited.

        "It is important to note that the decision-making process is a complex and highly intricate activity, which involves the accuracy of the information, a clear vision of objectives, and an understanding of the underlying issues. Errors in the decision-making process are common and can be done by any manager. However, there is a clear distinction between a bad decision and a wrong decision. In the case of the latter, the decision is the result of reliance on false or inaccurate information with the best intentions to make a correct choice. When it comes to a bad decision, a manager is aware of and has accurate information and a proper understanding of key factors but intentionally chooses the incorrect path. A bad decision might occur due to a wide range of factors, which can involve a conflict between a manager's self-interests and organizational objectives or merely emotional influence on the decision-making. However, wrong decisions require changes in the acquisition of accurate and reliable information on which the correct decision can be made. In both cases, it is highly",
        "The process of forming states is not characterized by ease. It involves many different processes, including cultural strategies of strength. It is believed that this aspect in the form of actions of social agents is of particular importance. This is because they occupy a central place in such processes as the formation of alliances and the establishment of dominance relations. Understanding this concept can give a better understanding of the creation of Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India. First, it is necessary to understand what a social strategy of power is and what significance it has. Thus, it is defined as a particular area of practice where the creators of mass media have cultural influences and act as agents of social change. Thus, these sources form and influence public opinion, which may affect the formation of states. Gledhill emphasizes that the main reason for the difference between state and stateless societies is the centralization and non-centralization of power. Thus, the absence of the second aspect is expressed in inequality,",
        "Culture is the entirety of social norms, behaviors, and customs which distinguish a certain society from the rest of the world. Naturally, some cultures have common features, thus forming cultural clusters. At the same time, leadership is a personality trait that transcends national boundaries. This does not imply that all people with power behave in the same manner, as leaders are also influenced by cultural norms. Behavior differences are evident in the way people in different clusters view time. Middle Eastern cultures are frequently juxtaposed to Western ones, particularly American. Beehner writes that while \u201cmost Middle Eastern nations are past oriented\u201d and uphold traditions, \u201cmany Americans believe they can control the future and embrace change for the sole purpose of changing\u201d (72). Barak Obama is an example of a leader who gained prominence by articulating the importance of change. The list of differences in leadership behaviors is not limited to the perception of the future. Crede et al. have conducted a study in which they ascertain cultural differences in relation to transformational leadership. (23). The most peculiar finding is that \u201ctransformational leadership exhibits stronger relationships with subordinate performance in cultures with low levels of gender egalitarianism values\u201d (Crede et al. 23). This implies that the more traditional a culture is, the more successful leaders are likely to be in transformational endeavors. Altogether, there is a definite influence of culture on the conduct of leaders. Therefore, the definition of culture should include the importance of its effect on leadership behaviors. Not only does culture distinguish a certain social group, but it also underscores",
        "The suggested strategies to mitigate the effects of coronavirus in accordance with the example of Iceland could be considered as an interesting approach. This strategy acknowledges its apparent limitations, such as the resilience of the Iceland community, geographical idiosyncrasy. However, currently, this strategy might not be a valid method to address the high margins of infected individuals in NATO countries. It is certainly true that quick response and high testing rates would contribute to the deterrence of the effects imposed by the sudden growth of the number of infected. However, it is similarly meaningful that the population would be willing to undergo such a measure. Moreover, despite the financial support efforts, some countries belonging to the organization might not be able to financially withstand the high amount of testing imposed by the new waves of infection. This fact is especially relevant given that the virus dissemination might emerge across several countries simultaneously. Therefore, a different approach to the problem might be necessary. The Israeli government approached the problem of monitoring the infected with",

In such conditions, competent and high-quality change management and decision-making are essential. In an age of global transformation, change management has become one of the principal success factors for most companies. The surrounding reality is in a state of constant shift: the demands of internal and external customers are changing, new market barriers and opportunities are emerging, unforeseen risks are occurring.

The central concern is that for most employees, rapid change causes a feeling of anxiety and discomfort. It often causes longer sick days, days off, constant",
        "The two American regions to be first settled by the English colonists were New England and the Chesapeake Bay. In the Chesapeake Bay, the colonists arrived under the auspices of Virginia Company \u2013 a joint-stock enterprise dedicated to colonizing America for profit. Although the early hopes of finding precious metals did not materialize, the region eventually found its economic specialization in growing tobacco (Corbett et al., 2022). The company hired the English poor for the labor-intensive task of growing the colony and producing tobacco, and most of the newcomers were young single males (Corbett et al., 2022). Conversely, the New England colonies followed a different settlement pattern. Unlike the Chesapeake Bay, they were shaped not by the pursuit of profit but by the desire to escape persecution and perceived moral decadence of England and create a virtuous society (Corbett et al., 2022). New Englanders came to America as entire families and, unlike the Chesapeake Bay colonists, established a largely self-sustaining economy of farms, hamlets, and commercial enterprises rather than cash crop plantations (Corbett et al., 2022). Such were the differences in settlement patterns and shaping forces between the two. Religion played a considerable role in both regions, although in the shape of different denominations. The founders of New England colonies established their settlements with an explicitly religious purpose of creating a perfect Protestant community, which was the case in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and other colonies as well (Corbett et al., 2022). Interestingly enough, although the Chesapeake Bay colonies were business enterprises intended primarily for profit, the Anglican Church also played a considerable role in their",
        "The secret of IKEA's success on the global market lies in its perfect execution of all components of the marketing mix. The company has adapted its strategy to each market with precision, flexibility, and creativity that made its products highly recognized. The ingenuity of its marketing mix proposal can serve as an example for other companies in Europe and worldwide. In this paper, the four components of IKEA's marketing mix will be discussed. This Swedish company has gained renown for the quality, accessibility, and innovativeness of its products. First of all, the firm's pricing strategy is focused on affordability, as the structure and logistics of its stores are optimized for a maximum price reduction (O'Neill, 2021). Promotions of this store chain are widespread through all communication channels, ranging from local radio stations to social media accounts made for each region individually. IKEA stays on top of modern advertising strategies and employs influencers to reach younger audiences (O'Neill, 2021). Regarding its locations, IKEA continuously selects places where it will remain accessible for the public while keeping its prices at the lowest. However, the most notable feature of this company is its products. Its home furniture is easy to recognize for its style, modularity, and reusability (O'Neill, 2021). There is a constant stream of new products in IKEA, giving customers a reason to keep visiting it on a regular basis. In conclusion, IKEA's marketing mix shows how affordable, stylish, and recognizable products are able to capture customers' hearts and solidify a company's success for decades to come. There is a",
        "\u201cFences\u201d by American playwright August Wilson was published in 1987. This play is about an elderly scavenger Troy, a basketball star in his youth. It is worth mentioning that \u201cFences\u201d contains many essential topics for discussion which are relevant nowadays. For instance, the first scene reveals the duties and responsibilities of fathers and sons. There are many interpretations of \u201cFences,\u201d including staged and filmed versions, and it is important to discuss both to understand their features. The spectator sees James Earl Jones in the role of a strict father. His son, Lyons, is trying to figure out whether his father loves him, which constitutes one of this scene's essences. It is vital to say that each of the three versions, movie, play, and text, is unique, and the spectator perceives it differently. For instance, Lyons, the son, asks his father about Troy's affection for him. Indeed, he does not receive an expectable answer. Instead of confessing in love, Troy explains what it means to be a father. \u201cIt is my duty to take care of you\u201d is a strong phrase that shows another variety of fatherly love (Niko Papastefanou, 2011). The excerpt from the play demonstrates Troy almost in anger; probably, he is unfamiliar with tender feelings, but he knows how to take responsibility for his family. The 2016 movie \u201cFences\u201d shows the same scene, but it is perceived differently. Here, the dialogue between Troy and Lyons is extended, and it allows for understanding the characters better. Moreover, the decorations are more realistic than the",
        "Levels of culture can be displayed in different planes and depths. According to Edgar Shein, who developed the concept \u2018levels of organizational culture,' and Edward Granter who later expanded on this concept, the culture of the entity can be seen in four levels: super-structural, symbolic, discursive, and cognitive (Granter, 2019). In other words, the levels of culture in enterprises are developed due to external economic and social influences, artifacts such as logos, story rituals and events, values explicitly expressed by the organization, and underlying assumptions. This paper aims to assess the levels of organizational culture for Macomb Community College. Artifacts in Macomb Community College show that it promotes concentration, attentiveness, and responsibility, which is reflected in the logo. Looking at the architecture of the buildings, some of which use chrome-plated modern high-tech structures, one can assume that technology and science are the main focus of educational programs. Nonetheless, the central older building and a park with large trees create an atmosphere of solitude and introspection, which is more in line with the study of fine arts and social sciences. Equally important, the college has a high culture of mutual help and respect and cherishes community relations, which is reflected in the developed bus route system available to students. On the value level, many signs within the college, including parking signs, library signs, and other clues, point to a love of order and organization. Probably in this college, teachers appreciate the composure and commitment shown by students. On the level of assumptions, the college probably seeks to avoid accepting students",
        "The article highlighted multiple reasons why women chose to be child-free. These include the desire to succeed from an academic and professional perspective, financial reasons, a lack of natural desires, and the understanding that a child would not enhance their life but rather make it more difficult (Sandler). There were a couple of things that I can't entirely agree with. The choice of a woman to be in a serious relationship with a man with a 15-year-old daughter without taking even minimal parental responsibilities appears to be inconsiderate for the young girl both from the perspective of the childfree woman and the father who accepts such conditions. Moreover, the statement that women are not more pressured into having children due to the possibilities does not correlate with the previous standards in which women who did not get married and have children had almost no opportunities in society. Based on the materials I have read, I would say that being child-free is a choice that everyone can make depending on the life goals",
        "The devastation and challenges of World War II were tremendous. The U.S. faced severe and significant objectives that would define the future state of America and European countries. It was essential for the U.S. to oppose Communist expansion in Europe and Asia, so there were specific policies that addressed this aim, and evaluating their efficiency and success may provide valuable insights. First, it is essential to discuss the policy of containment that was adopted by America and its allies. The purpose of this strategy was to prevent the spread of communism and respond to the Soviet Union's moves to expand its influence in a number of countries by providing struggling nations with more funding (Corbett et al., 2014). It is possible to say that this policy was effective because the U.S. managed to protect several countries from being coerced into communism. The second successful policy is the Marshall Plan aimed at several positive changes. The main idea behind this policy was to provide financial support to the struggling European nations,",
        "Melanoma is generally recognized as one of the cancers that have an increasing cover percentage, though it is usually diagnosed at early stages. Recently, the ways of melanoma treatment for patients with metastatic disease were so limited that many patients were practically doomed. Fortunately, melanoma therapeutics have developed for the past decade because of the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Now, people with stages II and III may easily have a long period of remission. Therefore, modern options for melanoma treatment serve as a source of hope for numerous people. Indeed, innovations in the sphere of melanoma treatment are connected with the use of checkpoint inhibitors and the so-called adjuvant therapy. According to recent research, \u201cthe use of anti\u2013CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitors and combination BRAF/MEK inhibitors for patients with BRAF V600 mutations has significantly extended survival and allowed some patients to remain in durable disease remission off therapy\u201d (Poklepovic & Luke, 2019, p. 1166).

Southern soul became extremely popular towards the end of the 1960s, and Brown had his first success in 1956 (Covach and Flory 218). Initially, Brown worked as a stand-in for Little Richard, and his first record, \u201cPlease Please Please,\u201d was quite thriving (Covach and Flory 240-241). Brown used to sing lead vocals, and his early musical style resembled that of the 1950s doo-wop (Covach and Flory 242). However, he began to develop the soul style in 1960 with \u201cThink,\u201d characterized by horns and a driving rhythm section (Covach and Flory 242). In 1964, Brown introduced \u201cOut of Sight,\u201d which represented the hard-driving soul style featured in his later songs towards the 1970s (Covach and Flory 242).

        "It goes without saying that Beowulf may be regarded as one of the most prominent ancient European poems. Although its origin remains the subject of multiple discussions, the common version describes it as \u201ca Danish poem in the Anglo-Saxon dialect\u201d (Neidorf 847). The poem describes the glorious life and deeds of a hero, Beowulf, who was regarded as a person sent by heaven for people (Gummere line 13). Helping Hrothgar, king of the Danes, he kills the monster Grendel and his mother. Later, when he becomes the king of Danes by himself, he has to fight a dragon that terrorizes his lands. Although he follows the beast and finally slays it, Beowulf dies, being mortally wounded. From a personal perspective, this poem reflects several essential aspects of human life. The first one is the issue of identity \u2013 in Beowulf, people were entirely associated with the glory of their",
        "The reason for the military conflict between the United States and Spain was the American government's support for the Cubans' long battle for independence from the Spanish crown. The US invasion of Cuba became evident when the USS \u201cMaine\u201d sank under mysterious conditions in the waters of Havana. Around the same time, in February 1898, hasty preparations for war began, while the Spaniards were accused in absentia of undermining the battleship (Mortenson & Springer, 2019). In general, one can talk about a long-term political game with Spain, in which several provocations tightened relations with the country on the eve of the war. The liberation of Cuba seemed like a financially attractive prospect for the US and provided strategic advantages. In addition, the American empire was then just gaining momentum and already had a successful experience in appropriating other territories of the Western Hemisphere (Kagan, 2019). The American government portrayed the unleashed war as a battle for the",

It is a way to quickly introduce the reader to the results of the research. In this article, the abstract is a brief overview of the topic that will be discussed. However, it contains no information about the methods of the research or its results. On this basis, such an abstract cannot be called comprehensive. The article's introduction is already more extensive, offering a general overview of the topic. It provides information that the times of coronavirus pandemic have affected nursing. In addition, the introduction has statistics, which introduce the reader to the subject in a tangible way. From the introduction, I learned about the general factors of COVID's effect on nursing, including increased mortality, changes in work practices, and increased workload. This introduction can be considered extensive and adequate. The research method of this article is",
        "The issue of tribal sovereignty has been scrutinized over the years, the treatment of tribes ranging from supportive measures and attempts of integration into the broader community to outright persecution. In this connection, the law about tribal gaming can be seen as a positive step towards recognition of tribes' unique way of life and self-determination. This essay discusses the question \u201chow tribal gaming act can add to the sovereignty of tribes?\u201d Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes were given the right to determine what gaming activities they wanted to engage in, and in most cases, the permission was granted by the state. Gaming activities could embrace tribal rituals or games of chance, depending on the wishes of the tribes and had to be agreed to by the state (Light and Rand). Since often tribal games are unique and have a deep meaning for the tribe, it would be right to say that granting tribes the right to hold their own games is necessary. This measure helps to uphold their culture and establish sovereignty over",
        "Developing a contract so that all parties involved could be aware of their obligations and meet them accordingly is one of the vital tasks for an organization. Charles Schwab, an organization offering banking and brokerage services, has developed a contract for its users to sign so that both parties could meet the respective requirements (Reder et al., 2021). For their collaboration. Since the contract in question contains the essential components of a legal agreement, it can be considered viable. Starting with the key definitions of the foundational concepts on which the agreement is based, Schwab's contract establishes the offer, acceptance, and legality terms from the start exceptionally clearly. The specified clarity and transparency benefit the company and its customers, promoting immediate trust and cooperation (Templin, 2017). Remarkably, Schwab also provides a robust basis for the consideration element of the agreement. Namely, the contract outlines the legal issues associated with the disbursement process, as well as the associated trading concerns (\u201cSchwab account agreement,\u201d 2022). Outlining that Schwab is not responsible for tracking the trading process, the contract sets the key responsibilities and relations between the parties completely clearly. Incorporating the primary components of a legal contract, the brokerage agreement created by Schwab offers its customers a chance to familiarize themselves closely with the services that they will obtain and the responsibilities that they have. Similarly, the contract outlines the crucial responsibilities of Schwab, thus, creating a basis for cooperation and the successful delivery of the end product to the customer. Overall, Schwab's approach to contract development can be considered a prime example of how a contract",
        "The study showed that bibliometric analysis of evidence gathered from integrative reviews and analytical studies had substantial implications for nurse-related and evidence based policy changes. Primarily, this is possible through the use of integrative reviews in designing new programs (Benton et al., 2020). The collective database of the synthesized studies as suggested by the authors of the study, can be utilized by nurses to be empowered through evidence-based materials in the formulation of changes in universal health coverage. As such, the applicability of this information has a number of benefits for working nurses, as they will be able to employ concise and trusted resources when advocating or implementing changes to policy. I think that nursing practice can be vastly improved with the use of well-managed databases that employ evidence-based research. This is because such a database will be able to illustrate gaps in knowledge of overarching issues as well as daily medical practices in the sphere of nursing (Houser, 2016). Similarly, it allows for insight into nurse-specific fields such as nurse education,",
        "There is no simple answer to what it means to be human. Some might say that being human means being independent and controlling their personal lives. For other people, being human means utilizing the refinements of civilization, wearing clothes, and going to work every day, i.e., doing everything that animals cannot do. It is also complicated to say how people want to live because everyone has unique requirements, dreams, and thoughts on this issue. This essay reflects on the On Being podcast and answers the above questions. In the podcast, Thich Nhat Hanh explains why people need to be human. According to him, \u201cwe have to remain human to be able to understand and to be compassionate\u201d (Onbeing.org 30:53 \u2013 30:58). The monk adds that being human means having a right to make mistakes, but the absence of a \u201cright to continue making mistakes\u201d (Onbeing.org 31:15 \u2013 31:20). Therefore, being human means being mindful, responsible, and open-hearted. In other words, being human is about being humane. People live in a",
        "Unemployment is a significant social and economic problem. Not always positive aspects of enterprise development contribute to a decrease in the percentage of unemployed. The negative impact may be cumulative along with phenomena such as inflation external factors, including the pandemic. Difficulties in obtaining an education for low-income families only widen the gap between the rich and the poor, which in America is already the largest in the world (Telford, 2019). Consequently, the leading causes of unemployment are inflation, advanced technology, and lack of education or skills for employment. Inflation drives up prices in the economy. Naturally, the price of both products and the materials they have produced increases. Employers seek to recoup the costs of inflation by constantly increasing the financial performance of sales. One of these methods is to increase the gross profit ratio by reducing the cost of production. As a result, the company seeks to optimize costs by reducing wages and saving on various employee benefits. This unfair practice leads",
        "Swimmer Lia Thomas attended the University of Pennsylvania as a student. In 2021, the media focused on her successes in sports as a trans woman. Lia Thomas, a first-time competitor in the women's division, had a strong showing. Early in December, she had her greatest college results of the year in Ohio, when she competed in the two hundred and five hundred meter sprints. After Lia Thomas' successes at university swimming pools, she was criticized following the fact that she was born a male, which gave him an advantage. Some people argued that because Thomas was taking testosterone therapy, he had an unfair advantage over other athletes. Describing her victory to be unfair was completely wrong following the fact that trans genders are always allowed to compete by themselves. Various suggestions have been put up, including the creation of a transsexual division in the NCAA if trans individuals have such an unfair edge. Men compete with men, women compete with women, and transsexuals compete against one another. Thomas's success in the",
        "Outreach Chicago is an organization providing help and services to homeless people and those underserved by already existing incorporations. The company's main mission is to provide help and necessities to humans for their subsequent successful reintegration into society. To practice deductive reasoning, it is essential to start by formulating a general hypothesis or statement that Outreach Chicago provides help to people (Adler & Clark, 2015). The observation allows us to find evidence for the statement as Outreach Chicago serves meals and distributes hygiene kits, coats, blankets, socks, and undergarments to people in need. The company's official site provides precise numbers of each aid type, so one can conclude that the company indeed provides help with various necessities since 2011 to people in need. Outreach Chicago states the average poverty rate in its area of performance is 34% among adults and 51% among children (Outreach Chicago, 2022). To practice inductive reasoning, it might be useful to compare data stated by the company with the other statistical sources regarding",
        "The healthcare industry typically draws sufficient attention to patients' education, especially when it comes to representatives of minority groups. That is why the article by McCurley et al. (2017) offers valuable information. The researchers demonstrate that Hispanic individuals deal with improved diabetes prevention when they participate in individual and group face-to-face sessions (McCurley et al., 2017). I believe that there is an apparent reason why such positive outcomes are achieved. It seems that face-to-face interventions are effective because patients have an opportunity to ask questions if they require explanations. Simultaneously, such educational sessions demonstrate that a patient is not unique with such a health issue. As a result, such interventions can improve people's morale, which, in turn, will lead to increased motivation to take preventive measures and protect health. This information allows for supposing that face-to-face interventions can be suitable to my practicum project that considers measures to improve access to care among African Americans with heart failure diseases. However, the focus on patients' cultural backgrounds should not lead to ignoring a broader context. This statement refers to the findings by Cajiita et al. (2017), who stipulate that the use of mobile technology in healthcare (mHealth) can promote better knowledge. These scholars focused on 129 older adults, and almost 25% were African Americans, to analyze whether mHealth leads to improved care (Cajiita et al., 2017). The use of mobile technologies can be as effective as face-to-face interventions because modern people spend more time online. That is why it is reasonable to rely on mHealth opportunities to improve access to care among African Americans. Finally, it is",
        "Since it is assumed that skiing is a rather traumatic sport, the company should have taken precautions for minimizing the injury risks for the skiers. However, in that particular case, the actions of the company's workers have created risks for health damage for Mr. Craig and Mr. Alex, who were actually injured. The fact that it was April and the slopes were supposed to be closed may lessen the degree of the company's responsibility in this particular case, but not completely. The company made a mistake letting people ski after the snowstorm though it could not have allowed people to do it. Hence, the company's actions endangered not only the skiers but the staff as well. Though Mr. Alex's injury was made by Mr. Craig, it is not only his responsibility in its causation. It would not have happened if Dan and Abby did not send him to the untested slope without any instructor who could have prevented Mr. Alex's injury. Hence, the health damage was caused both by the company",
        "Service marketing is usually defined as a promotion of an intangible good or a service to a particular segment of the audience. It is distinguished from product marketing by such features as Inseparability, Heterogeneity, Intangibility, and Perishability. This paper will focus on the last characteristic, perishability, which implies the impossibility of any storage or repeated use of the service. In case the service is not used, it is most likely to be lost forever (Hole et al., 2018). Examples of such can be a concert or a sports event. Sometimes they can be canceled either by a performing party or by a consumer. In this case, the service does not take place at all. Perishability also underlines a limited time of their use, which is usually specified. For instance, a concert of classical music which lasts for two hours. Because of these time constraints, the consumers can reasonably demand more from the services than from the products. Another implication of this feature",
        "Care ethics theory was thoroughly criticized based on the concept of slave morality. This idea was developed by Nietzsche and declares that discriminated people often create the mindset that enables them to treat their forced servant behavior as a kind of virtuous manners (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, n.d.). Thus, the urge and readiness to provide care are viewed not as a positive trait but lowliness that only strengthens oppression. The other criticism of care ethics lies in the notion that provided help is often parochial. Namely, the caregivers prefer their relatives, friends, and the citizens of their country over other people who need support but are distant from the organized help centers (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, n.d.). Therefore, the accusing ones hold that caregivers are rather selective and provide their services only to the local elite. The contrast of reason and emotion is valuable for understanding care ethics. As Held (1997) declares, \u201ca genuinely universal \u2026 moral theory would be one that would take account of the experience and concerns",

The author is an American sociolinguist prompted to research dude's functions and implications in the American culture by his undying interests in gender and language. Dude portrays a specific pattern of use influenced by its societal functions and meanings, thus explaining its high usage and enhanced popularity. Dude is mostly used by the younger generation of European American men when addressing one another and partly by women. Kiesling (2004) reports that \u201c\u2026 dude is used primarily by men speaking to other men, but not exclusively so\u2026 young women also used the term a significant amount\u2026\u201d (p. 287, p. 284).

        "Aristotle made a discovery fundamental to all logic by introducing variables. Thus, it was shown that logic is not just a specific doctrine of specific things or terms, but the science of the laws of syllogisms, such as modus ponens or modus tollens, expressed in variables. Studying various judgments, formal logic abstracts from their specific content, revealing a structure common to objects of different content. Syllogism is the discovery of Aristotle and is the main and most original part of his logic. In the theory of syllogisms, Aristotle defined syllogism and distinguished its types, defined working and non-working types of syllogisms, and established three figures of syllogism. I find it particularly interesting that Aristotle was the first to make reasoning methods the subject of scientific research. He introduced the methods of reasoning as integral formations and not just certain reasoning components. Everything that was done in logic before Aristotle just attempted to understand individual methods and principles without any systematization and unification",
        "The current global landscape of the agricultural economy is composed of large companies. In fact, their presence is prevalent enough to dictate and formulate policies and standards within the industry (Chemnitz et al., 2017). In practice, this has resulted in a number of discrepancies such as environmental damages, violations of human and labor rights, and even the lack of effort to minimize poverty. While the scale of the issue may seem too large to resolve, alterations of consumer buying habits have the potential to foster diversity within such industries. However, buying habits are only a small fragment of a number of interventions that are necessary. Perhaps the most vital change that is missing includes government presence. The most interesting aspect of the reading to me was focused on how the current size of the agricultural market was attained. The most prominent driver of such expansion was technological advancements that led to fundamental changes within the institution of the agricultural economy. Because machines were able to harvest in abundant amounts compared to employees, this created a substantial raise within the supply component of the economy. Companies also gained the upper hand by being able to sell quantities of crops before they were even sown. Such growth allowed even further expansion, though global companies would infrequently observe the effects of their actions on the planet, people in poverty, or farmers. Another interesting factor of the rapid and substantial expansion of the agricultural market was the evolution of food retail. Essentially, the effectiveness of retail operations currently influences purchasing habits and product availability, especially within developing and developed countries. As such, from an economic perspective, the size of a food retail firm dictates its",
        "\u201cInterpreter of Maladies\u201d introduces the reader to a collapsing world of a dysfunctional family. In the novel, Mr. Das sparks both sympathy and a sense of slight annoyance that is likely to transform into disdain after considering the evolution of his character. Although the character might seem benevolent and sympathetic at first, his evident inability to emotionally connect with his wife or children indicates the need for further evolution, which never occurs. At first glance, Mr. Das represents a character that is easy to empathize with and relate to due to his kind nature. Indeed, Mr. Das is mostly benevolent and kind-hearted throughout the novel. For example, he is never aggressive or unkind to his wife, her mostly being the one to start a confrontation: \u201c'But they're harmless,' Mr. Das said\u201d (Lahiri). However, Mr. Das should not be seen as immediately redeemable. Specifically, on a closer look, Mr. Das' unwillingness to interact with his wife or children becomes evident. For instance, when",
        "In a narrow sense, the \u201czero-sum story\u201d is a belief that there is a competition between racial groups, and any progress for one group is a threat to the resources and position of another (McGhee). This story is the mainstream paradigm for conservative media and has been told in different forms for years. The negative impacts of the \u201czero-sum\u201d paradigm on the United States are massive and diverse. This mindset created additional economic, political, and social costs for all citizens of the United States. One of the prominent examples demonstrated by McGhee is the history of public swimming pools in cities across the US. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were massive public swimming pools in many US cities, yet at that time \u201cpublic\u201d mostly meant \u201cwhite only\u201d pools. After numerous drowning incidents, local municipalities were told to open the pools for all people regardless of their race, which provoked a backlash from the white residents. As a result, cities preferred to close or privatize the public facilities instead of allowing people of different races to use them freely. This is an example of the destruction of public goods and a massive cost increase for the whole population due to the \u201czero-sum\u201d mindset. Another negative example demonstrated by McGhee is political in nature \u2013 many white people stopped pushing for social governmental policies regarding jobs and social benefits after the Black community joined the agenda. In the end, this means less social justice and social benefits for the whole country because",
        "One of the key aspects of the assessment includes risk analysis and goal setting, both of which enable a clearer direction and more detailed as well as the focused planning process. The video provides an insightful demonstration of how risk assessment and goal setting are conducted when dealing with a client. The assessment session begins with the risk assessment process, where a counselor asks a client whether or not he or she has suicidal thoughts. Regardless of the answer, the video shows that the counselor asks the client to report if she will start having such inclinations (Dr. Todd Grande, 2016). A similar structure is applied to tendencies of harming others with an equivalent request to report. The last part of the risk assessment includes questions about drug-related issues, such as hallucinations (Dr. Todd Grande, 2016). The goal setting process is initiated by questions regarding goals on the client's life in general, for which she responds with \u201cnice cushy job\u201d and \u201cbetter future for her children\u201d (Dr. Todd Grande, 2016). A more specific goal also needs to be identified, such as becoming drug free. The third part of goal setting involves objectives specifically for counseling itself, such as being less angry, sleeping more, eating less, and trying to quit drugs (Dr. Todd Grande, 2016). The confidence in achieving is also assessed, which can range from no confidence to full confidence. The very last part is about questions for the counselor and structure informing. In conclusion, the core elements of risk assessment include the questioning of risk factors, such as self-harm, harm to others, and drug-related issues. In contrast, goal setting involves general objectives, specific overall goals,",
        "The 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was introduced in the second half of the 19th century, manifesting the abolition of slavery across the country. According to the text, every citizen of the U.S. can neither enslave people nor be enslaved by fellow U.S. residents regardless of gender, race, age, or any other characteristic (U.S. Const. amend. 13, \u00a7 1). The abolition of slavery across the state has impacted U.S. history and the life of every American citizen, as this process initiated the restoration of individual freedom and nationwide democracy. Although currently, this Amendment does not have such a powerful impact on the everyday life of American citizens, it's phrasing implicitly affects the limitation of human freedom. The Amendment states that involuntary servitude is abolished except for the cases of criminal punishment, and the lack of further explanation of this phrase currently leads to high imprisonment rates among racial minorities in the U.S. The 15th Amendment to",
        "Overpopulation in cities has become one of the most critical problems of our time. This is both an environmental and a social problem. The city cannot grow indefinitely and provide decent workplaces for every resident. The ecological burden is also increasing. Uncontrolled growth in the number of cities leads to the unchecked spread of pollution and the escalation of poverty. However, there are several preventive measures that the Government can implement to combat this problem. First of all, overpopulation in cities is congestion and traffic jams, which lead to serious pollution problems. Atmospheric pollution is the most serious in cities, and its primary source is road transport, which emits sulfur dioxide and nitrogen into the air in huge quantities. The second main problem is poverty: disadvantaged groups in rural areas live in poverty (Innes et al., 2019). Some of them decide to settle in the city because they believe that they can easily find work. Their main goal is to provide for their family, but almost none have the necessary education for a good job. These people come to the city and become a service class. They suffer from the prejudice of indigenous people, poverty, and worse working conditions. Another inconvenience due to overcrowding is the garbage from residents, which is difficult to dispose of (Namberger et al., 2019). In many European countries, this problem is solved thanks to separate garbage collection (even in houses, there are separate garbage cans). Then some of the garbage is recycled, some are incinerated at incinerators. In conclusion, to solve traffic and air pollution problems, people should use public transport as often as possible, rather",

        "Individual freedoms and national security are sometimes seen as two opposites. However, in ideal, national security should reflect the balanced relationship between the two mentioned concepts. Moreover, the principle of the prevalence of individual freedoms over the national security underlies the democratic idea. Individual freedoms include individual rights and are protected by the US Constitution (Longley). This paper argues that individual freedoms should never be sacrificed in the name of national security. This essay proposes that the protection of individual freedoms by maintaining national security is a fundamental principle and goal of democracy. US President Joe Biden notes, \u201cI strongly believe that democracy is the key to freedom, prosperity, peace, and dignity\u201d (Biden 3). Unlike authoritarian or totalitarian systems, a democratic system puts individual freedoms ahead of national security interests. The implementation of this principle always raises controversy, since there is no single rule universal for all cases. However, individual freedoms are protected in most areas of social life, including migration, cyber security, economic stability, and international diplomatic relations.

Although, it is difficult to judge the extent of the Syrian threat to Canadian interest during the outbreak of coronavirus, which seems to continue even today. Therefore, it would be essential to review the proposed question for a more effective approach to the defense of Canadian interests. Nevertheless, this act protects the interest of both Israel and Canada and will positively impact their relationship. Furthermore, it is notable how the Canadian government is willing to cooperate with the withdrawal of troops from Iraq if the official request were to be made.

Clearly enough, it is impossible without a thorough understanding of a company's business environment. When it comes to entering the market with the goods for the purchasers' consumption, the one theory that specialists often take to is the supply and demand theory. This theory is utilized to understand the customers' buying behaviors and help managers strategize the product in the market in accordance with them. For instance, a lack of demand for the product signifies that supply needs to be shortened \u2013 and vice versa: when there is an increase of demand, it is reasonable to enhance supply of goods as well. Additionally, a supply and demand analysis helps in pricing: if the demand for the product is high, buyers are more likely to accept price increases an keep on purchasing it.

These responsibilities appear to have been firmly defined during the Anglo-Saxon period. The poem Beowulf belongs to the epic or heroic poetry genre, which has poems that commemorate the characters' brave and martial actions. Women are portrayed as belongings for the advantage of the men throughout Beowulf and are made to support the male characters. In addition, women are utilized as plot devices to advance the story tale of men. Women, on the other hand, are a minor character in the plot, their presence being overshadowed by the men. The queen of the Swedes was given no name, her identity being secondary to her status as the king's wife, Onela.

        "Everyone has read detective stories at least once in their life or watched detective programs on TV. Sometimes it could be seen that the heroes of the works use so-called indented writings. These writings can be on the second, third, and so on pages, depending on the pressure on the writing subject, that is, a pen or pencil. Even though such records are difficult to see, the examiners still have the experience and specialized equipment to ensure that this concealment was revealed. Indented writing is invisible indentations in the sheets of paper located under the page on which the information was initially written. Indented writing can help solve a case, as it often has the information necessary for the investigation (Girard, 2017). In order to see the inscriptions, one can use a pencil, but for forensic experts, it is an unprofessional tool that can only harm the evidence. Indented entries often do not match the information written on the surface of the original document. To open the information, specialists use various professional equipment. It includes a device for a laboratory that works to restore documents with indents. In addition, a photographic method is used, which is based on sliding light, and an electrostatic detection device is also used (Girard, 2017). Naturally, specialists must have the necessary skills and knowledge to detect information written using indentation. Moreover, the use of a soft pencil or copy paper can spoil essential details, and therefore the use of these methods of amateur examination is prohibited. In conclusion, indented writing is a common practice in the criminal world. When writing with indents, the necessary",

The first act I would like to analyze is the creation of the Public Works Administration (PWA).

According to Rosenberg (2019), Mary Mallon was \u201cthe first \u201chealthy carrier\u201d of typhoid fever\u201d recognized in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century, which made her infamous as Typhoid Mary (para. 1). This woman was found to be a typhoid bacteria carrier, and healthcare authorities accused her of 47 illnesses and three deaths, isolating her on an island for most of her life (Rosenberg, 2019, para. 45).

        "A digital engagement policy determines how the organization intends to position itself online. The regulation also covers the company's brand qualities and its vision and mission objectives. It also directs how employees can communicate digitally, both internally and externally, with suppliers and clients (Brown, 2019). In addition, the above guidelines also target social media interaction practices that may affect the business, either negatively or positively. Our organization has a digital engagement policy that it utilizes to protect the reputation of its brand. Moreover, the above strategy has enabled the business to increase employees' commitment while boosting the levels of their obligation. Hence, workers share more about the organization online, thus, contributing to more sales and profit. Additionally, with the above rules in place, the firm's private information is secure since it is not shared online.

Lerner proceeded from the fact that in the process of modernization, all societies move in the same direction, which was set by the Western countries that had completed modernization earlier. However, this \u201cWestern model,\u201d according to Lerner, is, in fact, global. It acquired its name only due to a historical confluence of circumstances. Countries of the North Atlantic were the first to carry out the processes of secularization, urbanization, and industrialization. Analyzing the modernization of lifestyles based on empirical material, Lerner pays the most attention to the growth of population mobility, the spread of literacy, and the mass media. For example, Lerner dwelled on the problem of restrictions for modernization. Among the most critical factors hindering development, he attributed ethnocentrism.

        "Miranda warning, also known as Miranda rights, is a formal statement in which a person being arrested is informed of their basic civil rights under the jurisdiction of the United States. Through this warning, an officer of the law enforcement notifies the individual of their right to remain silent, as well as to an attorney. Such principles reflect the foundation of the legal system of the United States, in which both sides are protected by a comprehensive set of rights in order to eliminate bias and enable an objective investigation of the case. The obligatory nature of the warning serves the interests of both sides of the process. First of all, the person being detained possesses an inherent set of rights, which must be respected within the framework of the court of law. They are guaranteed by the United States Constitution, and depriving a person of them would be a major violation of this fundamental law. Rogers and Drogin (2019) state that it would be a misconception to believe that every resident is fully informed",
        "The editing in the first episode of the series Money Heist is in line with its thrilling plot and rapid action. In the first scene, as the character gets ready to exit her vehicle, the editing is quick, focusing on the items she is picking up. Similarly, the camera often focuses on objects, leading the viewer towards the items that will become an essential part of the narrative. For example, one can see the ringing phone before it is picked up. Moreover, the show uses rapid editing with close-ups and the use of objects that identify characters \u2013 guns, money, and other items that show one's motives or their identifying trait. The characters' close-ups are dynamic, often using dolly shots to slowly expose the background or move with the character. This way, the camera does not stop as long as the characters move or the whole room is exposed. When they stop, the editing is as rapid as the conversation between people. In monologues, the dolly is used again",
        "The concept of nursing is closely associated with the idea of continuous improvement, as the trends of health care need to mirror the existing social trends to provide the best care possible. One way to secure such care is to refer to the latest scholarly findings to modify the approaches to care provision in the workplace. This process of implementing research-based findings in daily patient care is known as evidence-based practice (EBP) (Wilson & Austria, 2021). Currently, EBP is not used actively by nurses for several reasons. First, the workload of most nurses discourages their desire to learn and embrace EBP. According to McArthur et al. (2021), a physical opportunity is a construct that contributes to the nurses' ability to resort to EBM. Physical opportunity includes such barriers as \u201ccost and lack of resources, compromised communication, staff turnover, and limited physical guidelines\u201d (McArthur et al., 2021, p. 20). As a result, management promotes behavioral patterns that react to the environment rather than examine it in advance. The second massive barrier",
        "Anorexia nervosa is a treatable eating disorder when people significantly limit the number of calories and types of foods they eat, which leads to excessive weight loss. Anyone may be affected by anorexia, and about 1-2% of the population suffers from the disorder (Cleveland Clinic Medical Staff, 2021). Key symptoms include: Emotional and mental signs: fear of gaining weight, obsession with counting calories or diets, irritability, self-criticism, and other characteristics. Behavioral signs: changes in eating habits, excessive exercise, and other features. Physical signs: weight loss, fatigue, weakness, and similar symptoms. Pay attention: Anorexia is possible even if there are no underweight signs, and one needs to pay attention to other symptoms. Genetics and family history: brain chemistry impacts appetite, mood, and self-control; therefore, people who have relatives suffering from eating disorders are at a higher risk.

        "Global climate change, as has now been proven by the latest research, is caused by human activity. Awareness of the seriousness of the situation is gradually penetrating into world public opinion. There is still an opportunity to mitigate the consequences to avoid the worst. People can all unite in order to change the situation, even though this process may be gradual and take some time. The main difficulty is connected with the extremely uneven distribution of greenhouse gas emissions between developed and developing countries, large and small. However, it is possible to change the situation by taking small steps. For instance, the population should use public transportation instead of cars. When using cars, there is an enormous amount of exhaustive fumes released in the atmosphere. This initiative can contribute to lower gas emissions, further reducing the consequences of global warming. Additionally, people can start saving energy by drying laundry on a rope, not in an electric dryer. One may also set a lower switch-on temperature on the heating system thermostat (What Are the Solutions). What",
        "Perspective is an important consideration in art, one that determines the way people look at a painting and what they see, how they see it, and how they interact with it. Additionally, it is responsible for the way people understand an image in its cultural context or intended meaning. While exploring the google arts and culture exhibit, I have been able to see a number of different religious paintings that use perspective in interesting ways. I think that the discussion of perspective is important for those both close and far from the art world, as it promotes engagement with paintings that can often be overlooked. To narrow down my search, I have looked up \u201cReligious painting\u201d, and went with the results that seemed most interesting to discuss. First, I want to take a look at The Adoration of the Magi, painted by Sandro Botticelli. The image depicts people adoring a number of \u201cwise men\u201d who were considered to be especially important in Florence, where it was painted (The adoration of the magi \u2013 sandro botticelli \u2013 google arts & culture). The linear perspective allows the audience to see everything that is happening from a detached angle, taking in the scenery and understanding the importance of the event to the people depicted. While the magi are being revered by the people of Florence, the audience also understands that they are close to their followers, therefore placing them in close perspective proximity to each other.

        "Gendered behavior denotes fundamental expressions of gender socialization and identity through an individual's various developmental phases. Thus, gendered behaviors refer to the ways persons behave according to their respective male or female genders (Au & Rudolfsdottir, 2021). One of the prominent gendered behaviors instilled in me during childhood was that women are the primary cooks in the home. Hence, from childhood, I learned how to prepare food for the family, unlike most male relatives around. Even the movies mostly depicted women as the cooks in the home. Perhaps the gendered role that I quickly adopted/ accepted from childhood was the idea that women are natural caregivers. The function depicted women as noble people who consider the plight of others in the home and society and consistently seek to alleviate suffering. Women are warm, nurturing, and caring. Thus, many regarded professions that require empathy like nursing and teaching to the women's domain. The idea that women are more humane and caring appealed to me and caused me to accept the role. In my mind, the part admitted what many would prefer to ignore/ deny: women play critical roles in retaining sanity in the world. For me, the role meant that women could play vital functions in stemming the tide of oppression, suffering, and cruelty evident even from childhood. Therefore, the idea that women are more caring and naturally nurturing appealed to me because it placed the gender on a nobler pedestal. Despite the perceived nobility of the gendered role that women are more nurturing and caring, specific adverse consequences emerged regarding employment",
        "Woman with a Parasol \u2013 Madame Monet and Her Son is a painting by the French artist Claude Monet, a founder and one of the most outstanding representatives of impressionism. Painted in 1875, this canvas became one of Monet's most well-known and influential works (Brodska\u00efa and Kalitina). The two figures in the painting are Monet's wife Camille and his son Jean. The lower third of the painting shows a grassy area, and the other two-thirds contain the figures of a woman and a little boy behind her. Monet's wife and child are the focal points of the composition. The lower viewpoint allows seeing the blue sky with white clouds behind the figures, which creates a unique lightning effect (Daily Dose of Art). Placed in the distance from the woman, the boy's figure also gives depth to the painting; this compositional technique guides the eye of the observer diagonally downward, which was common for several other works by Monet.

Florence was looking for an opportunity to help the poor and the sick. At that distant time, activities related to mercy, helping those in need, were considered an occupation not worthy of a noblewoman. The young woman sacrificed personal life expensive relationships with her parents but remained faithful to her calling. Furthermore, her values and commitment allowed Florence to become a historical figure in modern nursing, to whose leadership people owe accolades for paving the way of nursing's place in our societies. Thanks to perseverance and perseverance, in 1851, Florence entered the community of the sisters of pastor F. Flender in Germany, where she received a nursing education. Subsequently, Florence made a considerable contribution not only to the treatment of cholera help in wars but to the development of leadership and the reformation of nursing (Kim, 2020) The selfless woman became an",

        "In order to understand the structure and functions of society, it is essential to study a vast number of sociological theories and perspectives created by various scientists. For example, Emile Durkheim, a French sociologist, expressed his view of society in the theory of functionalism. According to Durkheim, there is vital interconnectivity of all the elements of any society that share common ideas and principles, and the sum of these elements is not as great as the society itself. The sociologist viewed society as a huge biological organism that requires all its parts to function properly in order to remain alive. Further, when discussing collective and individual behavior, Durkheim stated that these two concepts are entirely different, and there is the collective conscience that makes people adapt their actions and act in predictable ways. The concept of collective conscience is beneficial and positive as it defines and evaluates the norms of behavior. Nevertheless, not all sociologists share the same view on society. For example, there is also a conflict theory developed by Karl Marx. Unlike functionalism, conflict theory views society as a system with an ongoing class conflict, primarily between the proletariats and the bourgeoisie. The main cause of this conflict is the lack of resources and their unequal distribution, while its effects are connected with the necessary changes happening in society. Further, while functionalism focuses on collectivism, social integration, and the necessity of acting in similar and predictable ways, Karl Marx emphasizes individualism and promotes alienation that isolates a person from society. Finally, while Durkheim insisted on the ability of collective consciousness",

More specifically, it was primarily related to diversity in terms of sex and age since this combination frequently evokes the concerns of the population (King, 2021). The examination of the issue by relying on the example of Gerald Bostock was advantageous for establishing proper employment practices in this respect. In this lawsuit filed by the plaintiff, the main factor was his unjustified dismissal from the company in which he had otherwise positive reputation. This event was caused by the man's interest in a gay softball league which he expressed while being in the workplace while neglecting the provisions of Title VII (Mallory et al., 2020). This part of the Civil Rights Act, confirming the violation, was relied on by Bostock when initiating legal action, but it was initially dismissed by the district court due",
        "The work of a clinical or medical office worker is characterized by a combination of a large number of administrative operations with medical activities. Primarily, these professionals are office assistants filling out paperwork and interacting with staff (\u201cHow to become a medical office assistant,\u201d 2021). As a result, I will be approaching interviews for this job in a professional business style. While the fitting suit can be expensive, I already have the proper formal attire. Using my black formal suit, shoes, and minimal accessories, I can make the right impression without reducing my budget. In warm weather, I can go to an interview right in a suit, and in cold weather, I can add my usual outerwear, for example, an overcoat. Work clothes, theoretically, may require additional investments and purchases. All healthcare workers, including office workers, must wear a special uniform called scrubs, consisting of a short-sleeved shirt and trousers. This uniform is relatively cheap, and a single set of scrubs can be found on Amazon for about $20-$40 (\u201cMedical assistant's uniform,\u201d 2019). Most of all, in this context, one needs to take care of shoes since these specialists sometimes have to stand or walk a lot. A good pair of closed-toe shoes can cost around $100, but I have tennis shoes that fit the dress code (\u201cMedical assistant's uniform,\u201d 2019). However, it must be taken into account that many medical institutions issue uniforms on their own, considering them as consumables, so the choice of purchasing a uniform will depend on the rules of a particular hospital.

        "With the widespread use of digital technology, email has gained particular importance. With email, communication has become much easier, as people have been able to communicate with colleagues, relatives, loved ones, and business partners and representatives of organizations, literally in real-time, avoiding all the difficulties of \u201cphysical\u201d communication. However, what is interesting is a study of the extent to which such communication has been modified with the advent of the phenomenon of email. In the context of interpersonal communication, two effects should be highlighted. First, email has meaningfully broadened the scope of communication so that communication is no longer only realized in the real world but can easily be continued online as well. This has changed the perception of interpersonal communication and greatly simplified the availability of communication. Meanwhile, email has changed the perception of nonverbal communication through emotions and body language, since in text correspondence, especially of a business nature, such expressions of speech do not make sense (Smith, n.d.). Of course, there are alternatives in the form of emoji and stickers, but in emails, as a rule, such forms are rarely used, unlike in messengers. From these features, an essential advantage of email is highlighted, namely increased accessibility, the possibility of virtually limitless communication, and staying connected with people at all times. However, there are also disadvantages: dependence on Internet equipment, the need for an electronic device, and any cybersecurity concerns. It is easy to make mistakes in electronic correspondence, as individuals automatically try to extrapolate real-world communication skills to the digital world. These mistakes include ignoring the type of interlocutor and lack",
        "The concepts of domestic violence and abuse refer to psychologically or physically aggressive behavior of one family member towards another. This aggression could take the form of beating, rape, screaming, and humiliation. Unfortunately, in the modern world, these are common phenomena. According to statics provided by Huecker et al. (2021), 10 million Americans per year suffer from violence and abuse. The victims of domestic violence and abuse feel depressed and helpless, and their self-esteem is also extremely low. Fear of the aggressor might force a victim to keep calm about the experience of being abused. Nonetheless, there are signs via which a provider could suspect domestic violence, child abuse, or elder abuse. If a woman arrives at the emergency room with bruises or fractures that do not as she slipped on the wet floor, a nurse could suspect that her partner beats her. In addition to that, victims are highly likely to be depressed and anxious even though they might try to hide these emotions (Lloyd, 2018).",
        "Being a knowledgeable and experienced professional in one's professional sphere is, without a doubt, of great importance. For this reason, many students of medical education facilities seek to acquire as much theoretical and practical expertise as possible before graduation. Although such a strategy is by no means wrong, I have recently discovered that the true success in the work of healthcare providers is explained by the doctor's ability to build relationships with one's patients. I fully understood the advantage of this simple but often overlooked truth when observing Dr. Wang's work. Dr. Wang is an experienced professional working in the sphere of eye surgery. Yet, it was surprising for me to discover how easily he/she is able to build close relationships with the patients. After analyzing her/his behavior, I realized that there are certain skills that allow Dr. Wang to gain the trust of the people that come to the Eye Surgery Institute. First of all, he/she is an active listener meaning that all of Dr. Wang's patients are encouraged to",
        "Various cultures around the world have unique creation myths and traditional methods of presenting them through art. The cosmology of the Aztec civilization was quite different from the Europeans that conquered them. Firstly, the Europeans' Christian God \u201ccreated mankind in his own image\u201d and granted him dominion over a perfectly constructed world, the Garden of Eden (Holy Bible, New International Version, Genesis 1:27). In the Bible, he is described as a benevolent, if strict, father figure who can forgive humankind their sins and grant them eternal redemption. Consequently, God is depicted in art as a wise, older man with a beard and white hair. Christian art primarily praises the power of His forgiveness and the bountiful nature that He created. In contrast, Aztec creation stories are based on dismembered gods, and thus the origin of the world is catastrophic violence, which explains why Aztec art depicts divinity as gruesome and awe-inspiring",
        "It isn't easy to single out the central directions and build a particular hierarchy in the modern art world, including music. Some of the performers influence the minds of young people, and political strategists can use some compositions during elections. The current state of the art is too vague to make clear statements on this subject. Hip-hop performers expose many of the problems of megacities and young people: drugs, cruelty, violence, and lack of life guidelines (Rabinowitch, 2020). The social movement for women's rights is significant for the modern generation, and female performers are becoming iconic people in music. One such person is Lady Gaga, who began her career as a freak with a sensual mezzo-soprano. Performers like her describe the issues of discrimination and harassment emotionally. Some critics single out Moby as an iconic artist who influenced the formation of modern cultural reality. He brought a unique genre and popularized it by making his songs available to the public, including for the political life of the United States. There is a problem with expressing yourself through flashy statements within the framework of modern culture (cancellation culture, hate speech, shaming). In this context, of course, the past artists were bolder, but there was a different world, a different reality, and society for them. The public space is dynamic, and artists should now look for other ways to draw attention to themselves or to this or that issue (Rabinowitch, 2020). The information space is already crowded, especially within the Internet. It isn't easy to surprise a modern young listener, attracting their attention and keeping them. It",

        "There are numerous US criminal cases that raise the question of trying juvenile offenders in adult courts. Currently, almost in half of the states in the country, juveniles can be prosecuted and tried in adult courts. Pennsylvania is one such state, as there is no lower limit for the age someone can be charged as an adult with homicide. The 2009 case involving a double murder illustrates the numerous issues that take place in all similar cases. In February 2009, state police found 26-year-old Kenzie Houk, who was eight months pregnant, in her bed with a bullet through her head. Jordan Brown, the son of the victim's fianc\u00e9, is one of the youngest suspects in the country to be charged with murder. According to Heide (2021), juvenile murder arrests in the United States increased dramatically from 1984 to 1993, leading experts to forecast an epidemic of continued violence. Since then, numerous approaches and techniques have been tested to reduce juvenile violence. Nevertheless, they have not provided a highly efficient uniform framework that can assist in mitigating the issue. A wide range of factors should be taken into account when realizing the reasons for such a severe problem in the country. Moreover, a dedicated analysis is needed to realize the effectiveness of the already existing programs and institutions aimed at reducing the risks of violent crime among juveniles. Furthermore, the issue of recidivism should be widely discussed, as preventing it has always been considered one of the primary goals of the institutions that work with juvenile criminals.

His death was reduced to a symbol, but it was much more than that (Sinzelle, 22). It was an act of defiance against a corrupt government that had killed its citizens. It sparked a revolution, overthrew the regime, and may even have caused the Americans to enter the Vietnam War. However, the monk himself most likely did not die for revolutionary ideas.

        "In the grand scheme of things, prosecutors and victims of violent crimes are natural allies. The prosecutors strive to bring the offenders to justice, whether to fulfill their duty before the law or achieve career progress. At the same time, the victims get moral satisfaction when the criminals are brought to justice. Therefore, one might think that prosecutors and victims are naturally supposed to cooperate. However, this logical scenario does not necessarily happen in practice. Sometimes, the victims cannot adequately cooperate with the prosecutors due to the experienced shock, fear, or mistreatment in the prosecutor's office. During the mid-70s, the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration funded the first Victim/Witness Assistance Projects (VWAPs) in order to enhance cooperation between the prosecutors' offices and victims (Karmen, 2019). With time, the VWAPs have become firmly established institutions charged with the noble mission of supporting crime victims.

Even though many companies had adopted the new revenue recognition policy, both preparers and auditors experienced significant difficulties applying the new accounting standards in practice. The central problem was that the new standard, unlike GAAP, does not provide sufficient detail on the implementation rules. Instead, it gives a theoretical basis similar to all industries, which leaves the details open for interpretation.

This company was founded in 1985, and its first year in the market was already characterized by a huge loss and an enormous amount of debt. However, thanks to the changes in American governmental policy related to the natural gas industry operations, Enron managed to rise. Now, it is necessary to analyze this case and evaluate the fatal mistakes that the corporation made. There is an extended number of different theories and assumptions about the reasons that Enron struggled and then filed for bankruptcy. First, the projects that the corporation invested in turned out to be too risky and failed, which resulted in the inability of Enron to pay its debts (The Nigerian Professional Accountant, n.d.). Other issues like abuse of accounting and utilization of SPEs to hide the corporation debt added to the major problem that may be defined as an identity crisis. As noticed by researchers, there were two ideological systems that competed and dictated how Enron was supposed to function (The Nigerian Professional Accountant, n.d.). The first ideology, known as the asset-light",
        "Ageism is a global problem of discriminating and stereotyping people based on their age. It contributes to prejudice in society, causing a psychological impact on individuals and creating biased attitudes toward certain populations (Ayalon & Tesch-R\u00f6mer, 2018). Media is often responsible for stereotyping different age groups, in particular, older adults. This paper aims to discuss two examples of ageism and one example of a positive characterization of the elderly in the media. Cliches and stereotypes about older adults in advertising cause negative attitudes in people as they present unrealistic and out-of-touch messages to the audience. For example, \u201cThis Is Getting Old\u201d is an advertisement by E-Trade that depicts older adults working jobs they hate and cannot perform because they have not managed to save enough for retirement (Advertising TV, 2018). This stereotypical video is ageist because it supports bias and discrimination against older workers, people struggling financially, and the elderly in general. Another example of ageism is an advertisement, \u201cDear Young People, Don't Vote,\u201d where older adults urge the youth not to vote (NAIL Communications, 2018). This video is ageist because it portrays the elderly as a selfish, indifferent, and uncaring category, which is inaccurate and discriminative. A positive example includes an advertisement by DocMorris, where an older man persistently exercises to lift his granddaughter to help her put a star on top of the Christmas tree (Sport for Business, 2020). This video is respectful, supportive, and heartwarming as it pictures an older individual who can achieve goals and live a fulfilling life. To conclude,",
        "Gender Stereotypes and Discrimination Nowadays, gender stereotypes and sexual discrimination make people confront various issues which may lead to negative consequences. For instance, Sandberg (2010) discusses why men reach top positions in the workforce much more often than women. During her lecture, Sandberg addresses this problem by providing current statistics on the male and female employment gap, suggesting that it is highly more challenging for women to choose between personal life and career success. Overall, the Ted Talk is highly insightful, offering the viewers a chance to reflect on modern gender inequality difficulties. In this Ted Talk, Sandberg also raises a question regarding the changes that are needed to alter the current disbalance in the number of men and women that achieve professional excellence. From my perspective, this is a vital issue, and I would like to explore the possibilities for addressing it. One of the most critical reasons for inequality is related to gender differences established in society. Brown et al. (2022) discuss so-called gender roles, which are \u201cdifferences in how men and women are supposed to act\u201d (para. 9). Such a phenomenon should not exist in the first place because men and women might presume that there is a particular script they should follow while living their lives. As such, this issue is especially important for me, as I strongly believe that every individual is free to choose their path in life regardless of their gender. However, I know several people who believe that women should spend more time at home doing housework while men should work more and make money for the family. Thus, my question for",
        "The clothing industry is amongst the many monopolistically competitive industries. There are many clothing firms in the industry competing against each other while producing similar products. However, the firms in the industry earn competitive advantages by distinguishing their products through branding and advertisements (Davis and \u00d6zg\u00fcr, 4). Product differentiation is one of the strategies commonly used by monopolistic competitive firms. Product differentiation in a clothing firm can involve designs, the quality of materials used, and the prices charged for the clothes. In advertisements, differentiation is put in physical aspects such as color, designs, elastic, and different sizes (Davis and \u00d6zg\u00fcr, 7). Intangible aspects included in the clothing advertisement can be guaranteed money back, high quality, free delivery, and long-lasting usage. Steel manufacturing is an example of an oligopolistic competitive industry. In such a market, a few steel manufacturing companies rule over other firms. The few firms are the price and trendsetters for other small companies and often form a partnership to operate successfully (Ritz 185). To distinguish themselves from their competitors, they improve their product quality, hike or lower prices, and advertise the special features of their products. In an oligopolistic market, if a leading company lowers prices, the others do not follow but rather improve their products to remain in the higher cuts of prices (Ritz 187). The few leading companies also stay competitive in the industry by setting their standards high to prevent easy entry into the industry. The firms set high standards by producing the highest quality products, selling them at a higher price, and producing them in high quantities",
        "Subsidizing programs are considered welfare and net initiatives that the government takes to aid low-income families and individuals affected by poverty. These programs offset the essential needs of the citizens from health, food, housing, and education. Such an initiative aims to allow people access to quality services and save some money for their personal growth. The subject of whether the subsidizing of essentials causes an incentive or de-incentive to seek employment is a debatable one. An example of a subsidized program is the subsidized housing, House Vouchers, and Public Housing programs. This scheme was initiated specifically for the poor and the disabled. Through the plan, citizens from economically low backgrounds and those physically impaired could afford to live in private and government-owned rental houses. Generally, it can be argued that the programs have a great potential of incentivizing recipients to seek employment. For instance, most job opportunities are found in urban centers. Having an initiative that makes life affordable in the towns and provides cheap residential houses encourages people to seek jobs in",
        "The rock and music pop scene were introduced to and gained popularity on television through massive hit shows for teenagers. The three primary ones were Where the Action Is on CBS, Shinding on ABC, and Hullabaloo on NBC. As more households had access to televisions along with the growth of widespread range of programming, including musical ones, the television played a significant role in distributing the music to the public. The bands that appeared on these hit TV shows went on to see significant success in the charts. The television shows helped to articulate the new sort of youth music culture and almost became a star-making mechanism in a relationship and profits that the music and television industries shared. Some bands, such as the Monkees, the American response to the Beatles, were created with the purpose of television performance as their acting and on-camera comfort as a group were initially prioritized over music. However, the Monkees' music took off astronomically beyond anyone's expectations. Nevertheless, they were a band groomed by the entertainment industry with",
        "An aboriginal person is an individual characterized as a descendant of indigenous inhabitants of Australia. Before the arrival of Europeans, the indigenous people of Australia occupied most of the land, which they protected and fertilized to support cultivation. The aboriginal people mainly practiced hunting and gathering as their source of livelihood before adopting agricultural practices. The aboriginal people arrived in Australia from Asia via Southeast Asia and have inhabited the land between 45000 and 50000 years ago. After the arrival of European colonialists, the indigenous people faced many challenges such as economic, political, and disruption of their tradition. The aboriginal people lost their culture, land, and family without considering the extermination of European imperialism policies; they became enslaved by the Europeans. During the colonial period, the indigenous people faced a high rate of discrimination, resulting in displacement since the colonial powers occupied a large part of the fertile lands, resulting in many deaths of indigenous communities. For instance, over 200 languages the aboriginal people",
        "The Alabama State constitution strives to provide and protect a wide array of citizens' rights. Most notably, some of these rights are replicated in the American Bill of Rights. Like the American Bill of Rights, the Alabama State constitution is equally detailed and has different sections that are dedicated to enhancing and protecting citizens' liberties. The standout element within the Alabama State constitution regarding the protection of rights is the freedom of speech. Within the Bill of Rights, The First Amendment guards the citizens' freedom of speech as it enables them to not only express themselves through speech but also via protest groups (Weinberger, 2019). The Alabama State constitution echoes similar sentiment as Section 4 prevents the development of any laws that would curtail the citizens' freedom of speech. To this end, the Alabama State constitution supports the Bill of Rights and emphasizes protecting the freedom of speech for the citizenry. Both the Fourteenth Amendment and Equal Rights Amendment deal with a similar concept of discrimination. On the one hand, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted to prevent former slaves from discrimination. Subsequently, black persons who had been formerly enslaved were conferred equal before the law (Young, 2018). On the other hand, the Equal Rights Amendment is an extrapolation of the Fourteenth Amendment as it guarantees equal treatment of all American citizens irrespective of their gender. At the time of its writing, women were often considered second-class citizens and were faced with numerous legal restrictions (Bleiweis, 2020). Therefore, while both the Fourteenth Amendment and Equal Rights Amendment were developed to target discrimination, their scope of application in terms of the people they",
        "The American War of Independence is between the American colonies and Great Britain. The revolution's success eventually depended on the willingness of Americans to risk their lives and economic well-being in the name of patriotism. The revolution was a conservative attempt to preserve freedoms that seemed to be threatened by British politics. However, the war was accompanied by social and intellectual transformations that radically changed the nature of American politics and brought ordinary people into politics to an unprecedented degree. It was the main reason why the Patriots were willing to risk their lives for the sake of independence and change. Firstly, the Patriots wanted the American colonies to gain independence from Great Britain as they wanted their own independent country. People in America felt they were being treated unfairly by the British (DiPucchio, 2020). They were taxed without voting or being represented by the British government. Soon, the first battles for freedom were heard throughout the colonies. The Patriots wanted freedom from British rule and fought for it. Secondly, the American fighters for",

Two, the absence of warranties with the pirated software means they are exposed to increased security risks with the software containing viruses and associated malware that affect computers (Parson, n.d.). Third, the individual or society is exposed to legal risks associated with pirated software when caught using it. Piracy results in economic risks that take away legitimate software sales to the software company. Law-abiding companies are forced to illegally share their work with others (Parson, n.d.).

Thus, medical practice using one's physiological status while nursing also implementing psychological responses is an effective way in making the difference between the two clear while operating based on PICOT. The points to be included are the difference in the research approach. Since medical practice is more objective due to the fact that it relies on specific outcomes and facts, the research is quantitative. On the other hand, the PICOT question included in the nursing practice implies mixed research that considers both opinions and data. Topic presents the differentiation between nursing and medical practice in terms of approach to diagnosis. The vital factor that is being brought up is the PICOT in relation to lab results versus assessment based on symptoms. The research can highlight the outcomes in terms of the accuracy of the findings while focusing on the comparison between the two concepts.",
        "In general, numerous types of reasoning exist and find implementation, but not all of them bear special significance for decisions affecting patient care. Approaches to reasoning can be classified into types based on the inductive or deductive direction of inquiry, the use of analogy or abduction, the utilization of decomposition and evidence synthesis, and so on. In the healthcare field, reliance on credible evidence is what informs the professional community's approach to clinical reasoning, given that mere suggestions and excessive experimentation and creativity involve extra risks for healthcare consumers. Particularly, the so-called frequency-based reasoning dominates the field, especially when it comes to guideline development, and it requires practitioners to rely on statistics in making clinical decisions (Wieringa et al., 2018). This way of thinking has diverse benefits, including the ability to limit reliance on questionable hypotheses and make virtually any decision integrated with the global healthcare knowledge base. To clarify the standards for reasoning and determine their levels, relevant evaluative questions must be posed. When formulating such questions, it might be essential",

Crisis intervention is a relatively new discipline, the main task of which is to provide temporary emergency emotional assistance to victims of mental and physical violence (Colford & Cavaiola, 2017). Nowadays, there is a risk of economic decline which can seriously affect the entire population; hence, I would not like to experience recession since it would significantly affect my life. The crisis is a phenomenon that takes a toll primarily on the individuals who work for non-profit organizations.

        "One of the most critical factors of breast cancer development is heredity since it causes a genetically inherent disease. If the patient's closest relatives have been diagnosed with breast cancer, a tumor's likelihood is high even at a young age (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2016). Since one of the patient's close relatives had this disease, this diagnosis is indeed possible for her as well. Another significant factor in developing cancer is various diseases of the mammary glands, for example, \u201ccystic\u201d breasts. In the presence of such conditions, the formation of atypical cells is possible in the mammary gland (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). This can lead to their overgrowth and increase the risk of more severe diseases. The hormonal factor also has a critical influence on health. In the described case, this aspect is the most significant since it includes various details of the patient's life. These include the first pregnancy after 30 years, not breastfeeding, and many years of taking hormonal contraceptives. This",
        "Students, parents, and teachers remain overloaded in today's educational system, which affects schools' efforts in building healthy relationships with the populations they serve. The categories above are heavily influenced by information overloads and the requirement to multi-task that permeates the modern educational system (Zarra, 2013). For students, it involves excessive pressure from the school system and even parents linked with remembering large amounts of subject-specific information, performing well on tests, and engaging in dissimilar activities to succeed (Zarra, 2013). The need to develop new IT and software use competencies aside from polishing their subject-related knowledge and managing school-family interactions can create an excessive workload on teachers. For today's parents, supporting children in their educational endeavors can be challenging due to an imperfect work-life balance and household management activities. Moreover, the recent popularization of distance learning might create additional responsibilities for parents, including controlling the student's learning process. Schedules and culture support schools' relationships with students and parents to a great extent. As",
        "The book, \u201cCoaching habit: Say less, ask more & change the way you lead forever\u201d, is by Stanier M. Bungay. The publication was released in 2016 through Box of Crayons Press. The author and publishers claim that they give \u201cmanagers practical tools so they can coach in ten minutes or less\u201d (Bungay, 2016, p. 1). One major argument that comes up is that silence does not mean lack of knowledge or disrespect. This element has been stresses in some chapters of the book due to the fact that a significant majority of managers often associate silence to some level of disrespect. According to the scholar, many times, silence might also suggest a critical and keen thought process. Notably, the scholar explains that proper coaching would help managers and leaders realize such situations and help in the growth of both the junior staff and his or her supervisor. It can be argued that the author holds a general assumption that coaching only involves the manager. This is due to the fact that significant amount of advice given is directed to the supervisors. The role of the junior staff should also have been explored due to the nature of coaching. He explains that several elements, referred to as question masterclasses are critical for good coaching. The first question, also called the kick start question is critical. The author explains that it is a question \u201cin which you discover the power of an opening question that gets the conversation happening fast and deep\u201d",
        "An initial reaction rate is an instant rate at the beginning of the response. The graph has the y and x-axis, y stands for the concentration of moles per liter, and x stands for time in seconds. In this case, the chemical reaction is going against time; at the beginning of the response, the chemical concentration is very high, hence considered a positive reaction. As time goes by, the slope decreases, giving a negative curve; therefore, the reactant concentration reduces within an interval of time. Instantaneous rate is an instant rate in time with differential rate, the reactant against time. The instant calculation is by determining the negativity of the slope and the curve for the concentration of the moles per liter against time in seconds (Du et al., 2021 p 3154). Rate is equal to the negativity of the slope over time in seconds; this brings the instant rate and the difference between them, which gives the instantaneous rate. The reaction rate calculates the average over a time",

        "Panama is a developing country with a fast-growing economy located in Central America. It has one of the highest GDPs in Latin America but is not devoid of domestic economic problems, such as income inequality and poverty. This paper aims to review two current news articles about Panama, which reveal the issue of the high unemployment rate in this country, which continues to increase and has taken the form of a crisis. The first article appeared in a Panama news outlet called Newsroom Panama. It reports that, in 2021, 108,975 people in Panama were searching for a job, and the unemployment rates among women were higher than among men (Newsroom Panama, 2022). Unemployment results from a lack of new jobs, and the government has to pay subsidies to its citizens to help them survive (Newsroom Panama, 2022). This article is consistent with my findings that, despite fast economic growth, Panama has been experiencing increasing unemployment rates in recent years. The second article was published in Valley Post and is entitled \u201cJob Creation is a Challenge for Panama.\u201d It reports that COVID-19 has significantly affected employment in the tourism, retail, real estate, and construction sectors in Panama (Arzu, 2022). This source is consistent with my findings that the majority of the population in Panama is occupied in the service industry. When the main economic sectors cannot operate as usual, the country experiences a rise in unemployment. In conclusion, Panama is an export-oriented country, and services constitute the basis of its economy. Although the country's economy is growing, this growth is not noticeable to its citizens, many of",

The article claims that the right approach to supplier assessment, thus, is the key to a company's development and progress. The paper starts with various ways to address the issues related to MCDM of suppliers' selection. The most common ones are stated to be mathematical models, Simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART), analytic network process (ANP), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), data envelopment analysis (DEA), linear programming, and some others. For example, DEA is a methodology focused on a supplier system and classifies it either as efficient or inefficient based on selecting particular criteria.

        "The introduction of new levels of nursing education is a major reform that has contributed to the complexity of the field. Traditionally, nursing schools provided degrees of a Bachelor's level associated with the basic skills required by this profession. However, today, aspiring nurses have access to high-quality Master's programs that further develop their competencies. In this regard, a question may reasonably arise regarding the actual value of such degrees. In fact, Master's programs in nursing are essential for healthcare, as they align with the growing importance of nurses and the contemporary view of the system. Bachelor's degrees provide students with the basics of the profession, its fundamental concepts and practical skills. These aspects alone form a full-fledged, competent nurse who is capable of doing their job. In other words, a Bachelor's degree cannot be considered an \u201cincomplete\u201d education in nursing. At the same time, Master's programs serve as the development impetus for those who want to engage with more sophisticated principles of 21 st -century nursing. First of all, Master's",
        "The four goals of anti-bias education are forming identity, promoting diversity, teaching justice, and fostering activism. Identity formation presupposes that each child sees himself or herself as an individuum who associates himself with a certain family group. Diversity presupposes learning to respect differences between individuals and cultures. Teaching justice means teaching children to understand where wrong is done and to behave respectfully to all people (Derman-Sparks & Edwards, 2019). Activism is about educating children to be self-confident and not afraid to speak out for themselves. These goals are valuable since they allow us to educate people who will respect others, be responsible for their actions, and be ready to call attention to the wrongs that are done. The challenges of anti-bias education are making children behave respectfully even to those individuals they may not like, overcoming shyness in class, and teaching them to differentiate between right and wrong. When I was a child, I was very shy and it was a challenge",

This increases customer loyalty as clients feel they are helping the business support worthy initiatives, thus, enabling more access to funds and allowing more investors to join and support the company. The business rewards employees through meaningful praises, which makes them appreciated. It provides workers a chance to lead by example while giving them the capacity to make decisions without interference, demonstrating that they are trusted and capable (Yang et al., 2019). Additional monetary motivations comprise yearly or semi-yearly bonuses. Additionally, paid time-off and cash prizes help to boost performance while encouraging feelings.

        "In order to be successful as an organization, its managers and employees should devote themselves to certain principles and seek to fulfill them in real life. In this regard, Fisher (2008) suggests ten principles that, in the author's opinion, should be central for any entity. Nina, the Administrator of an outpatient dialysis facility, emphasized three core business principles, namely decide who you serve, manage employees, and decide what makes you different, which helped her run the facility successfully. As for the former, deciding whom to serve is a crucial step as it determines the focus of a company's activities. Secondly, managing employees ensures that medical professionals are constantly devoted to improving the quality of work and providing patient-centered care. Finally, deciding what makes you different ensures that the company makes constant improvements in regard to its performance and also establishes core values that can make them the most reliable and trustworthy facility. According to Nina, their mission statement is \u201cTo be the Provider, Partner and Employer of Choice.\u201d This correlates with the principles perfectly since every factor receives attention. The facility strives to provide opportunities and training services to their employees incorporating proper mental, physical, and holistic treatment of patients, which helps not only focus on the primary target, patients but incentivize the staff and remain unique. In other words, it can be called a commitment to constant learning and improvement, which is undoubtedly necessary for quality improvement in nursing practice (Caldwel et al., 2017). Therefore, it can be argued that the three chosen principles are of great importance in the healthcare sphere as they are",
        "Medical institutions function to protect the interests of patients and meet their needs; they are now the object of attention of society as a whole. The population's confidence in the activities of medical organizations is an essential indicator of their effectiveness. Bringing current terminology and the nature of the relationship between patients and physicians into a state of certainty will help to understand and delineate the nature of consumerism in health care (Calnal, 2010). The absence or lack of trust is of particular concern to patients. They feel vulnerable not only because they are sick but also because of the research and treatment they have to undergo. Improving the efficiency of the health care system is a policy priority for European countries. In today's world, patients expect adequate professional skills from doctors and high standards of interpersonal communication. In recent years, they have become more aware of medical options and the kind of care they can receive at specific medical organizations. Patients are increasingly comparing options at different clinics, learning a lot of information about doctors and medical services, as well as publicly available information about diseases (Calnan, 2010). The shortcomings of medical care, not the assertive consumerism, are causing the growing interest in self-education among patients. A negative consequence of this trend is the widespread use by patients of Internet materials for self-diagnosis and treatment. The vulnerability of patients undergoing treatment can be reduced by restoring trust between them and the treating physician. Moreover, appropriate training and highly qualified doctors are factors that determine how friendly and relaxed the clinics' clients will be about the manipulations they undergo. The destruction of",
        "Theodore Roosevelt was one of the youngest American presidents known for his progressive ideas and the desire to change society, addressing the existing distrust and helplessness. The decision to promote progressive ideas was not spontaneous, and he saw the movement as the possibility to protect the real rule of humans (Roosevelt, 1912). The characteristics of a progressive are the intention to stand for social justice, achieve good for all people, and improve the environment in which individuals should grow and develop. Being a progressive means being optimistic about every initiative and participating in problem-solving processes. There is no need to hide behind or keep silent but to act and become passionate about changes and transformations. Despite the desire to support progressive thoughts, there are also some examples of anti-progressives. Roosevelt (1912) called them the people with narrow vision and little sympathy. Anti-progressives are never stirred by the mistakes or failures made by other people (Roosevelt, 1912). Individuals who are consumed by their selfishness are not able to appeal to conscience. Everything they can do is to support oppression and use reforms that work for the leaders' success, not the public one. The activities varied from employees' exploitation to the promotion of capitalism that bounded society and imposed limitations on creativity and progress. Roosevelt wanted to make people believe in his ideas and goals. Thus, he described progressivism as the movement that aimed at underling the real rules and freedoms of society. It was high time to deliver justice and equality by explaining the worth of power and development. Following his rules, multiple achievements can",

        "According to Lufkin (2021), there is an urgent need to reduce the impact on physical and digital presenteeism in the era of pandemic and social transformations. This article focuses on the importance of recognizing true motives for presenteeism and defines the impact of subconscious biases on employee relationships. At the same time, the mere exposure and halo effects are associated with unfair or ineffective promotions that determine the quality of work. The idea that many biases unreasonably support presenteeism and negatively contribute to performance is correct, and differentiating employees' achievements using favors seems questionable. Presenteeism is problematic because most people continue addressing their subconscious beliefs about professional growth. Lufkin (2021) notices that not all employees can come to work early and leave late to demonstrate their devotion to the organization. Some people set priorities instead of achieving work-life balance and succeeding as an employee and a parent. They believe that their presence at the workplace helps get promotions or rewards, but the pandemic",

        "Circumstances and Encountered Issues In the case study presented, the overall setting surrounding the Asian Health Services (AHS) corporation appears to put additional pressure on the enterprise's executives. AHS is a prosperous organization that was able to process over 117,000 patient visits in 2014 and possessed seven sites in addition to three owned properties (Chung & Chin, 2015). However, with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the situation changed drastically, creating both advantages and disadvantages for AHS. Although ACA increased patient supply, the medical organization encountered a significant challenge when introducing new protocols to comply with the act's requirements. The ACA aimed to expand healthcare access and affordability, leading to an influx of patients who were previously uninsured. This surge in patient numbers initially appeared beneficial, promising increased revenue and the opportunity for AHS to expand its reach within the community. However, it simultaneously burdened the infrastructure and staff, requiring rapid operational adjustments.\n\nAHS faced the challenge of integrating new health information technologies mandated by the ACA, which necessitated significant capital investment and training efforts. Additionally, the increased patient volume meant that AHS had to maintain high-quality care standards while managing longer waiting times and ensuring adequate staffing levels.\n\nFurthermore, the diverse demographic served by AHS required culturally competent care and language services, complicating the implementation of new systems. The transition to value-based care models under the ACA also demanded a shift in focus from quantity to quality of care, urging AHS to innovate in patient engagement and preventative measures.\n\nOverall, while the ACA presented AHS with opportunities for growth and",
        "One of the social factors that might impact what groceries are purchased is the lack of healthy food. Addressing Wal-Mart in Forest Part allows me to gather enough information about available products and their prices. For example, one gallon of great value milk is $2.65, one loaf of Sara Lee bread is $2.44, one bag of gala apples is $3.58, and one bag of organic baby carrots is $3.88. Continuing my visit, the prices are as follows: one yogurt container is $1.92, 2-liter of Pepsi Soda is $1.98, and a box of Kellogg\u2019s Frosted Flakes costs $3.64. This snapshot of prices at Wal-Mart in Forest Park highlights a critical issue within the community: the affordability and availability of healthy food options. While some essential items are reasonably priced, the cost of healthier choices, such as organic produce, tends to be higher. This discrepancy plays a significant role in shaping consumers' purchasing decisions, especially for those with limited budgets.\n\nThe prevalence of cheaper, calorie-dense, and nutrient-poor foods can lead families to prioritize quantity over quality, inadvertently affecting their overall health. The impact is even more pronounced in low-income neighborhoods, where access to diverse and nutritious food options is limited. Wal-Mart, as a major retailer, has the potential to influence local dietary habits significantly. By providing more affordable healthy options, they could help bridge the nutritional gap in the community.\n\nThus, addressing the pricing and availability challenges of healthy foods at Wal-Mart in Forest Park is crucial.",
        "Every business must be managed carefully, and every detail must receive a fair amount of attention. When it comes to healthcare, such facilities must require even more attention because they focus on people's well-being. Performing such duties might be strenuous and expensive, and mentally demanding. As a Chief Nursing Officer, one will be faced with principles that include integrity maintenance, cash flow management, and employee motivation in the given circumstances. To start with, a healthcare business must always maintain its integrity. It can be evident that any business field should be focused on communication, which makes integrity a vital part of its operations. Ensuring transparency fosters trust between healthcare providers and patients, crucial in maintaining long-term relationships and achieving successful outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, cash flow management is pivotal in sustaining healthcare operations. Effective financial oversight ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, enabling the acquisition of necessary medical supplies and technologies. It also guarantees that staff are adequately compensated, reducing turnover rates and ensuring the continuance of quality care.\n\nLastly, employee motivation remains essential.",
        "Different circumstances under which medical staff has worked led to varying types of leadership strategies being developed. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the role of clear communication and the handling of prompt preparation in top healthcare leaders (Nicola et al., 2020). Another key tactic includes the use of external change agents that ultimately promote excellent organizational decision-making (Alagoz et al., 2018). Moreover, one study explained how implementing positivity-related and open-minded approaches as leaders can improve their employee's resilience, providing an additional source of motivation (Wei et al., 2018).\n\nThese strategies underscore the importance of adaptability and innovation in healthcare leadership. During crises like the pandemic, leaders who effectively communicated guidelines and swiftly mobilized resources were better positioned to manage uncertainty and stress within their teams. The integration of external change agents, such as consultants or partnerships, also proved essential in navigating complex challenges by introducing fresh perspectives and expertise.\n\nFurthermore, fostering a positive and open-minded work environment bolstered staff morale and",
        "Creating a legal definition for various ages is crucial for lawmakers in America. By establishing the boundaries between childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, it becomes possible to clarify the specifics of such periods and behaviors that the individuals might demonstrate. However, as explained by Scott (2000) in The Legal Construction of Adolescence, there are several complications connected to clearly defining the end of childhood and the overall period of adolescence. While childhood and adulthood ages can be specified by distinguishing between the children's vulnerability and adults' responsibility, adolescent populations' ages are more difficult to determine due to the transitional nature of this growth.\n\nAdolescence embodies a phase marked by profound physiological, emotional, and cognitive development, where the lines between dependence and independence blur. This period is characterized by an ongoing development of identity and autonomy, complicating legal categorizations. For example, a 16-year-old might be eligible to work and pay taxes but not vote or make decisions regarding their medical care without parental consent. This incongruity highlights the",
        "Retailers, Wholesalers, and Manufacturers are three stakeholder groups that can greatly contribute to the financial success or failure of a business. All three of them are involved in the supply chains of most middle and large-scale product-oriented businesses. The three groups have certain aspects in common but are drastically different in how they engage with a firm's products and its customers. The differences apply to the amounts of goods a group is dealing with as part of its function, as well as its direct role in the chain. Retailers earn money by acquiring things in bulk at a discount from wholesalers, who, in turn, purchase from manufacturers. Retailers focus on selling smaller quantities directly to consumers, emphasizing convenience and customer service.\n\nWholesalers act as intermediaries, handling large volumes of products and providing logistical support to retailers. They bridge the gap between manufacturers' large-scale production and retailers' smaller-scale demands. This allows for the efficient distribution of products and often provides retailers with a broader range of options without the need for",
        "The Spirit bear of the British Colony is a unique species of bears that amaze with their appearance and are of particular importance to the population of British Columbia. This type of animal is a kind of Kermode bear and is a subspecies of black bears, which often have dark fur (Service, 2017). However, due to a genetic mutation, some of the representatives of spirit bears have a white coat color, which is why they have such an interesting name (Langlois, 2017). Like many representatives of this species, they weigh an average of two hundred kilograms (Service, 2017). \n\nThe Spirit bear holds significant cultural and ecological value in the region. Known as \"moksgm'ol\" in the language of the Tsimshian people, the bear is revered in Indigenous cultures as a symbol of peace and harmony. These bears inhabit the lush rainforests of the Great Bear Rainforest, one of the largest temperate rainforests in the world.",
        "Communication and collaboration are crucial elements for the success of any individual and team effort. The first chapter of the book Technical Communication provides insight into the aspects of technical communication and its importance. I discovered that technical communication addresses two main tasks: assisting people in learning about certain phenomena or how to do a certain task. Additionally, technical communication can make others strengthen their attitudes, change them, or even take particular actions. I also found that technical documents reflect organizational culture, are made in collaboration and have distinctive elements, including a particular reader, clear instructions on resolving an issue, design, images, and structured information.\n\nThese elements empower individuals and teams to perform efficiently by providing precise guidance and fostering mutual understanding. When technical communication is executed effectively, it bridges gaps between diverse groups with varied expertise, enabling them to work towards common goals. Moreover, it plays a pivotal role in decision-making processes by offering well-researched data and analyses, thus promoting informed choices.\n\nThe collaborative aspect of technical communication ensures that diverse perspectives are considered",
        "The European powers had taken major parts of the world, including the Caribbean. In the 15 th century, the Europeans claimed the region following the establishment of Spanish settlements and conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires (Horne, 2018). Due to the conquest, it was easy for the Spanish to invade Mexico and Peru through exploration in strategic points of the Caribbean region. Following the Spanish invasion of the Caribbean in the 17th century, other European powers such as the British and French started settling in pivotal points such as the island of Tortuga and later moved to Jamaica (Horne, 2018). This development marked the beginning of a prolonged period of European imperialism in the Caribbean, which resulted in significant cultural, economic, and social transformations. The introduction of European agricultural practices, particularly sugarcane production, revolutionized the economy of the region. Plantations became central to the Caribbean economy, leading to a demand for labor that was met through the horrific practice of the transatlantic slave trade.\n\nThe influx of African slaves profoundly altered the demographic and cultural landscape of the Caribbean. African traditions, languages, and religions were interwoven with European customs, creating a unique Creole culture that has endured to this day. However, the legacy of slavery brought about profound social injustices and economic disparities that persist in the region.\n\nThe competition among European powers for Caribbean dominance also led to numerous conflicts and shifting alliances. The Treaty of Madrid in 1670 and subsequent treaties reshaped territorial claims, but the struggle for control continued well into the 19th century. Despite the eventual decline of European",
        "It is clear to modern people, as well as many people who lived in the 1930s, that the Second World War was inevitable. Some believe that the United States of America could prevent the outbreak of the war. However, this could hardly be possible due to several reasons. The American government maintained an isolationist foreign policy in the 1930s. The period was challenging as all countries had to address severe economic issues (Corbett et al., 2021). Americans wanted to concentrate on domestic matters, including a threatening spread of communist ideas (Russett, 2019). It is noteworthy that the USA could not overlook the catastrophic impact of the Great Depression, which necessitated a focus on economic recovery and domestic stability.\n\nFurthermore, the geopolitical landscape of the 1930s was marked by rising totalitarian regimes in Germany, Italy, and Japan, whose ambitions for expansion were largely unchecked. The appeasement policies of European powers, aimed at avoiding another conflict, inadvertently embold",
        "In order to better understand the higher prevalence of diabetes within the county, it is essential to observe both national and local trends of the illness. According to the CDC (2022), while new cases of diabetes have steadily decreased over the decades, the prevalence of the disease among people aged below twenty has not. Similarly, the prevention and management of diabetes among older adults is largely unsatisfactory and could be vastly improved. A number of socio-cultural factors also influence the prevalence of diabetes. For instance, individuals with Hispanic backgrounds are more prone to have the condition. Other factors such as age, lifestyle, and socioeconomic status contribute significantly to the patterns of diabetes noticed in different communities.\n\nLocally, the county has witnessed an alarming spike in diabetes cases, possibly exacerbated by limited access to healthcare services and a lack of educational programs promoting healthy lifestyle choices. Many residents may not have the means or knowledge to make dietary changes or engage in regular physical activity, both crucial elements in diabetes prevention and management. Nationally, efforts",
        "There is a growing number of physicians' encounters with the victims of human trafficking, sometimes even without recognizing them as such. Recently, Todres (2017) reported an incident, where Dr. W was requested to screen the women-employees of such a firm for sexually transmitted infections. On the one hand, according to the Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association (2011), it is necessary to safeguard patient confidentiality, including several aspects, such as physical, informational, decisional, and associational privacy. At the same time, it is obligatory to keep the records of all medical interactions meticulously.\n\nThis dual requirement places healthcare professionals in a challenging position. They must balance the ethical obligation to protect patient privacy with the legal and moral responsibility to identify and assist trafficking victims. Often, victims may not self-identify or may be accompanied by their traffickers, which makes it difficult to provide appropriate interventions without breaching confidentiality.\n\nTo address this complex issue, healthcare systems should implement specific training for recognizing",
        "The foundation myths of Rome represent some of the qualities vital for a successful state in antiquity \u2013 decisiveness, militancy, and political and social flexibility. Historians of different sorts have been trying to understand and interpret the story of Romulus and Remus since its creation. The following stages of Rome's supposed history also raise many questions regarding fratricide, abduction, rape, and also the backgrounds of Rome's first citizens. The fact that according to most of the myths, Rome started from fratricide seems to be quite relevant as the city's history is famously filled with internal strife and conflict. This violent beginning reflects the tumultuous path Rome traversed in its rise to power, marked by civil wars, political assassinations, and the strategic annihilation of rivals.\n\nDespite its turbulent origins, Rome's capacity for adaptability allowed it to incorporate diverse peoples and cultures into its expanding dominion, demonstrating impressive social and political flexibility. This inclusivity ultimately strengthened its empire, turning former adversaries",
        "Portraying the lives of gods and depicting relationships between them, as well as their interactions with humans, both \u201cIliad\u201d and \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d elaborate on the theme of power abuse by those at the helm. In \u201cIliad,\u201d Agamemnon has to face retribution due to his constant abuse of power: \u201cbe ready, that I be not left,/Alone of all the Greeks, without my prize\u201d (Homer, 762 B. C.). Likewise, in Ovid\u2019s \u201cMetamorphosis,\u201d the gods often wield their power capriciously, impacting the lives of mortals who are subject to their whims.

        "The rate of patient mortality in intensive care is a growing concern for medical practitioners. Although the cause of patient motility may be attributed to many factors even before the individual reaches the CCU, it has been reported that an effective tube placement during resuscitation aids healthy circulation. It is not known if the nurse's knowledge of capnography affects its use in critical care units. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the relationship between nurses' knowledge of capnography and its use in coronary care units. The project will provide valuable insight into factors affecting the use of capnography, thus enhancing patient outcomes by potentially reducing mortality rates in intensive care settings. Capnography, which measures the concentration of carbon dioxide in exhaled air, is a crucial tool in monitoring ventilation efficiency and ensuring the correct placement of endotracheal tubes during resuscitation efforts. Despite its importance, the use and effectiveness of capnography can be significantly influenced by the healthcare professional's level of understanding and training.\n\nNurses, who are often at the frontline of patient care in coronary care units (CCUs), play a pivotal role in implementing this technology. This project aims to bridge the knowledge gap by assessing how well nurses understand capnography and how this understanding translates into practical application. Through surveys and observational studies, the project will identify educational deficiencies and barriers that prevent optimal use of capnography.\n\nBy analyzing these factors, medical institutions can tailor training programs to enhance nurses' capabilities, ensuring they are equipped with the necessary knowledge to utilize capnography effectively. Ultimately, this could lead to improved",
        "The phrase that caught me most from the video is from Isaiah, stating that Samuel has taught him that one person can play t-ball and hit it hard when sitting down. This is a powerful statement indicating that people can be prejudiced despite having good intentions. Samuel's family did not realize the struggles disabled people go through before he was born (PinehurstPictures, 2010). The child's image hitting the t-ball also showcased a powerful issue, that disabled individuals should be treated similarly to other people and given equal opportunities to give them the chance to perform optimally. I was deeply moved by this visual and its underlying message. It reflects a broader societal issue where individuals with disabilities are often underestimated or overlooked, despite their potential to excel under the right circumstances. The scene with Samuel hitting the t-ball while seated serves as a poignant metaphor for the need to dismantle societal barriers and biases that limit opportunities for those who are differently abled.\n\nIn many communities, there exists an implicit disbelief in the capabilities of disabled individuals. They are frequently subject to lower expectations, which can hinder their development and self-esteem. Samuel's story is a testament to the remarkable achievements that can occur when such individuals are given the chance to prove themselves. It emphasizes the importance of inclusivity and equal opportunity, not just in sports, but in every aspect of life.\n\nThis narrative challenges us to reconsider our perceptions and biases. It calls for a more empathetic society that recognizes and celebrates the strengths and contributions of all its members, regardless of physical or mental differences. By doing so, we empower individuals like",
        "Slavery has been one of the most problematic aspects of the history of humankind. Slavery developed as European trading and marine settlements required additional labor in the American colonies (Harris, 2018). Settlers comprised enslaved people from Native Americans and forcibly brought Africans, using slave labor in every part of the economy, from sugar production to harvesting and exploration of raw materials (Harris, 2018). The practice of slavery in British North America can be characterized by how colonists regarded enslaved people. As slavery gradually spread across America, each area had distinctions. For instance, Jamestown in Virginia became the first settlement in 1619 to utilize African slaves, setting a precedent for the plantation economy that would dominate the southern colonies.\n\nThe North developed a more diverse economy, yet it was not exempt from the grasp of slavery. Northern states engaged in the transatlantic slave trade and industries dependent on slave-produced materials. Despite regional differences, a commonality remained: enslaved individuals were seen",
        "A Western scholarship has distorted the long history of African culture for centuries, and many of its basic principles have been viewed through the lens of colonization. As a result, the ideas and tenets of African philosophy have been appropriated and changed in value from the inherent parts of people's nature into commodities. In their works, p'Bitek and Marimba discuss such concepts as culture, spirituality, and philosophy of African nations and how Western ideology has reshaped their presentation without fully understanding their meaning. The commodification of African culture and the imposition of European views on the distinction between culture and philosophy have led to a misunderstanding and undervaluing of African intellectual traditions.\n\nThis distortion arises from a Eurocentric perspective that often prioritizes Western epistemologies, disregarding the rich diversity inherent in African thought. By examining African culture solely through a colonial framework, the genuine essence and complexity of African philosophies are overshadowed. The true value of African cultural expressions lies not in their commodification but in their ability to provide",

The research meticulously analyzes survey data collected during this period, revealing a notable divergence in inflation expectations among different demographic groups.\n\nThe study underscores that during times of economic uncertainty, inflation beliefs are heavily influenced by personal experiences and economic literacy. For instance, individuals with less financial education or those directly affected by job losses exhibited heightened concerns about inflation.",
        "The global pandemic caused by the COVID-19 has led to severe issues in the labor market. To be more particular, the number of unemployed individuals is considerably higher than prior to the global lockdown (The Economist, para. 2). Naturally, such a situation happened due to businesses going bankrupt or reducing the number of employees to survive the economic crisis. The Economist elaborates on the statistics of the unemployment rate and shares the amount of time it can take for the labor market to recover to its prior-pandemic state (para. 1-3). This issue is complex, intertwining economic, social, and policy dimensions that require multifaceted solutions.\n\nFirstly, the economic repercussions of the pandemic have not only disrupted the livelihoods of millions but have also exposed the vulnerabilities in existing employment structures. Many jobs, particularly in industries such as tourism, hospitality, and retail, have been lost indefinitely, prompting a need for reskilling and upskilling initiatives. Governments worldwide face the challenge of implementing policies that stimulate",
        "Economic globalization is an inevitable process due to many reasons, but many people argue that it has a detrimental effect on the development of many countries or even the entire world. Nevertheless, globalization positively influences the evolution of human society at large, although some adverse effects are apparent (Wade, 2004). First, it is essential to understand the benefits of economic globalization to embrace it rather than try to oppose it. Undoubtedly, economic globalization enables people to trade more efficiently and effectively as they have access to diverse resources and markets. An entrepreneur in every part of the world can offer products and services to people beyond their immediate geographic location, thus expanding their business reach and potential for growth. This connectivity facilitates the exchange of ideas and innovations, catalyzing technological advancements and cultural exchanges that enrich societies globally.\n\nFurthermore, economic globalization can lead to a more efficient allocation of resources. Countries can specialize in producing goods and services where they have a comparative advantage, maximizing productivity and fostering economic growth. This specialization not only boosts national economies but also contributes to global economic stability and development.\n\nHowever, critics of globalization often highlight its role in exacerbating income inequality and cultural homogenization. While some regions thrive, others may struggle to compete, potentially leading to job losses and economic disparity. Additionally, the dominance of multinational corporations can overshadow local businesses, impacting cultural diversity and economic independence.\n\nDespite these challenges, the overall impact of economic globalization is largely positive. By fostering interconnectedness and economic collaboration, globalization encourages a more cohesive and prosperous global community. Understanding and addressing its drawbacks while embracing its benefits is crucial for ensuring that the process contributes",
        "The \u201cEye of the Storm\u201d video is a fascinating example of how race can be socially constructed in the classroom. Jane Elliott created a distinction between blue-eyed and brown-eyed children, teaching the young participants that their peers with brown eyes were superior (Bloom). Although this contrast does not possess any inherent meaning and is merely a representation of one's amount of melanin in the body, it became significant for the children. Thus, Elliott socially constructed race by suggesting that one group of children is better than the other, with the eye colors serving as symbols to emphasize race and group dynamics.\n\nThrough this simple exercise, Elliott demonstrated how easily children, and by extension society, can internalize arbitrary distinctions and let them dictate social interactions and hierarchies. The exercise illuminated how prejudice is not innate but taught, and how societal structures exploit visible traits to perpetuate discrimination. This social experiment mirrors the broader processes by which societal institutions assign value to certain racial groups, often based on superficial characteristics, thereby legitimizing social stratification",
        "The differences between the Persian and Greek cultures can be seen in several traditions and customs. In Persia, the distinction between different religions and languages was accepted by the society, allowing people from the conquered territories to continue practicing their ancestral traditions without being persecuted (Brooks, 2019). In contrast, Greeks were less tolerant of other religions and cultures, enforcing submission to Greek customs from the populations residing in their territory (Brooks, 2019). Another significant dissimilarity was the citizens' attitude toward the authority, with the Persian residents voluntarily supporting the King and remaining strongly loyal to him (Brooks, 2019). This loyalty was deeply rooted in the Persian respect for centralized power and the king's embodiment of divine rule. Conversely, the Greeks, who cherished individualism and autonomy, frequently questioned authority. Greek city-states like Athens valued democratic principles, allowing for public discourse and debates, which were absent in Persian governance (Brooks, 2019).\n\nThese cultural nuances were reflected in",
        "The main difference with regard to various gender theories is how they explain the gendered differences in behaviors characteristic for both sexes. When applied to the issue of behavioral problems in males, different theories find their causes in different sources. Biological determinism would explain behavioral issues in male students through the concept of male nature as inherently and naturally competitive, aggressive, and even violent (Tilling, 2013). However, this essentialist theory is at odds with the now well-established understanding that, while some people are predisposed toward delinquency, social influences are a far more prominent cause thereof. Social constructivism, for instance, posits that behaviors are not biologically predetermined but rather shaped by cultural and social contexts. According to this view, males may exhibit behavioral problems because societal norms often encourage expressions of dominance and competition among them, impacting their actions and interactions.\n\nFurthermore, gender role theories suggest that from a young age, boys and girls are socialized differently, which leads to distinct behavioral outcomes. Boys are",
        "Diana Kendall claims the current perception of the class has been a construct of the media and based on the construction, the meaning of class is determined. Kendall argues that the media has legitimized inequality in the United States through the assumption, with television programs and newspaper articles creating and reifying class-based stereotypes. Furthermore, Kendall argues that class discussions in the media are rarely explicit; however, their portrayals generate perspectives that impact human behavior. The upper class in society is portrayed positively, while the lower class is framed negatively. On the one hand, the upper class contains individuals that should be emulated for their success, intelligence, and sophistication. The media often highlights their luxurious lifestyles, philanthropy, and influence, painting a picture of aspiration and admiration. On the other hand, the lower class is frequently associated with failure, incompetence, and lack of ambition. This portrayal not only reinforces existing stereotypes but also obscures the structural barriers that contribute to economic disparity.\n\nBy consistently framing the narrative in this manner",
        "Terrorism is one of the main problems faced by humanity in the 21st century and, despite considerable countermeasures, it remains topical. Islamic terrorism is one of the most prominent forms of the radicalism of the past decades, which manifested itself in several tragic events. The movement began when Osama Bin Laden formed al Qaeda in 1989, which conducted its first attack in Yemen by placing a bomb in a hotel housing American troops (\u201cOsama bin Laden,\u201d 2020). Osama Bin Laden espoused the idea of worldwide Jihad, a holy war of Muslims against the infidels and especially focused his efforts on targeting Western influences in the Middle East.\n\nThe impact of Islamic terrorism has been profound, shaping international relations and domestic policies globally. The September 11 attacks in the United States were a watershed moment, leading to the Global War on Terror and significant geopolitical shifts. These acts of terror not only cause immediate loss of life and destruction but also propagate fear and distrust among communities",
        "A trade secret is one of the most valuable components of a company's functioning, which can provide it with a significant competitive advantage. Hence, it consists in confidential information that describes the processes or things that characterize the organization. It can be a phrase, a slogan, a symbol, or a mixture of these aspects. To qualify for a trademark, the information must correspond to specific points. It must have commercial value for the company, must be known to a limited number of people, and fall under such documents as consent to conceal data for the persons by whom it is used. Unlike a patent, which requires public disclosure and offers protection for a limited period, a trade secret can potentially remain protected indefinitely, as long as the company maintains its confidentiality.\n\nThis indefinite protection often makes trade secrets highly appealing to businesses. Famous examples include the Coca-Cola formula and Google's search algorithm, both of which are zealously guarded to prevent competitors from gaining access. However, the reliance on secrecy also carries risks. If a trade secret",
        "Commitment to health theory is a special model designed to determine the stages of development and behavior changes. This theory assumes the development of an internal state, as well as the acceptance of the desire to lead a healthy lifestyle under the conditions that any circumstances may limit a person. Moreover, with the help of this theory, the necessary level is determined, which indicates a particular stage of human health (Kelly, 2014). In addition, this theory assumes that there are no established differences, such as gender, race, and others, in order to build behavior aimed at developing a healthy lifestyle. In this context, the Commitment to Health Theory is instrumental in fostering inclusivity and universality in health promotion strategies. By focusing on internal motivation and personal desire rather than external conditions or demographic factors, this model empowers individuals from all backgrounds to embark on a journey towards improved well-being. This theory emphasizes that anyone, regardless of their starting point or societal challenges, can cultivate habits conducive to a healthier lifestyle.\n\nThe model operates on the premise that personal commitment and readiness to change are crucial determinants of success in health behavior modification. By identifying specific stages of health development, individuals can receive tailored interventions that cater to their unique needs and circumstances, thus enhancing the likelihood of sustained healthy behavior.\n\nMoreover, the theory's disregard for demographic distinctions helps eliminate biases and ensures that health promotion is equitable and accessible to all. It encourages healthcare professionals to focus on the psychological readiness and personal goals of individuals, creating a more personalized and effective approach to health education and intervention. Consequently, the Commitment to Health Theory serves as a foundational framework for developing",
        "The article of Zulaika (2022) presents the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on adolescent pregnancy and school dropout among secondary school girls in Kenya. The cases of teenage pregnancy started in Kenya after the country-wide school closure that started from March 2020 and lasted until January 2021. Zulaika (2022) examines to what extent the pandemic affected sexual and reproductive health of adolescents in Rarieda subcounty. The study shows there was a limited involvement of health administrators on the issue of pregnancy among school girls. Teenagers lack sexual education and are not adequately informed about contraceptive methods, leading to an increase in unplanned pregnancies during the extended school closures. The pandemic exacerbated pre-existing vulnerabilities and created an environment where adolescents were more prone to dropping out of school due to pregnancy or the need to support their families economically.\n\nThe disruption of education and lack of access to reproductive health services during the lockdown period are critical factors contributing to this troubling trend.

        "The adjustment process of new children and their parents can be challenging for them and the teacher. An educator can implement many educational and communicational techniques to ease the process and support the children and parents. I believe that maintaining constant communication with parents through conferences or phone calls, with the consideration of their time and privacy, is one of the most important elements. Encouraging home learning activities and welcoming parents into the classroom is also crucial. Most parents would like to be involved in or informed about their children's adjustment in a new classroom. Gaining parents' trust by properly communicating with them and understanding their concerns can significantly enhance the adjustment process for new children. When parents feel confident in the teacher's ability to support their child, they are more likely to collaborate effectively. This collaboration fosters a nurturing environment that aids in the child's social and academic development.\n\nTeachers can also implement classroom activities that promote inclusivity and peer interaction, helping new students feel more welcomed and less isolated. Activities that encourage teamwork and communication can help children build relationships quickly, easing their transition.\n\nMoreover, providing regular updates about the child's progress and adjustment to the parents can help alleviate their anxieties. Personalized feedback allows parents to understand their child's strengths and areas for improvement, enabling them to reinforce learning at home.\n\nFurthermore, creating a supportive classroom atmosphere where diversity is celebrated can make new students feel valued and respected. Teachers can introduce cultural projects or story-sharing sessions to highlight each child\u2019s unique background and experiences. This not only enriches the learning environment but also fosters empathy and understanding among students.\n\nIn conclusion, by employing a combination of",
        "Both lookism and extreme body modification are inherently linked to unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standards of modern society. This trait aside, however, the two are very different in their manifestations and direct consequences. Lookism is merely the act of considering someone whose appearance is not what most people would regard to be beautiful. It focuses on exhibiting negative judgment to people that do not fit the standard and is thus oriented outside of the person who engages in it. Extreme body modification, on the other hand, is the act of changing one's body in order to look in a way that deviates from the norms that society sets on appearance. \n\nWhile lookism imposes a socially constructed hierarchy of attractiveness, extreme body modification challenges these perceptions by rejecting conventional aesthetics. The former perpetuates discrimination and marginalization, often resulting in diminished self-esteem and opportunities for those deemed less attractive. Meanwhile, extreme body modification, though sometimes criticized for health risks, can be an expression of individuality and a defiance of normative beauty ideals. It represents",

The main hero can be looked at from diverse perspectives; therefore, the creation of Frankenstein's character can be seen as believable or even sympathetic. Due to his life difficulties, such as losing many of his family members or friends, Frankenstein is generally pitied by the majority of the audience. Later, the reader can understand that the main hero feels quite lonely and pays much attention to his research and studies to cover this inner loneliness caused by the loss of his beloved ones. Despite several inappropriate or sometimes immoral actions performed by Victor, such as his reckless experimentations with life and death, his motivations are often driven by a genuine desire to push the boundaries of human knowledge.\n\nVictor\u2019s passion for scientific discovery is a positive trait, showcasing his brilliance and ambition. However, his obsession blurs the line between innovation and hubris, leading to tragic outcomes. This duality in his character makes him a complex figure rather than a straightforward villain",
        "While the situation with the COVID-19 pandemic is critical, the case with mandatory vaccination at work is controversial. I think it is justified because it helps stop the pandemic; those unwilling to vaccinate should be ensured that they will not facilitate the contamination by the coronavirus. However, such a decision requires additional measures to ensure that the vaccine is safe and beneficial for the human organism. Despite a lack of time, as the pandemic must be conquered as soon as possible, the laws which require massive mandatory vaccination, under a threat of high fines, are the radical measure.\n\nThe balance between individual freedom and public health is delicate. Mandatory vaccination policies pose ethical challenges, as they can infringe on personal autonomy and spark resistance. It is crucial that governments and health organizations transparently communicate the safety and efficacy of vaccines to build public trust. Ensuring that vaccines undergo rigorous testing and monitoring is essential to alleviate fears and misconceptions.\n\nMoreover, incentives could complement mandates, encouraging voluntary compliance through education and community engagement. By fostering a",
        "It should be noted that there is a multitude of motivational factors to consider for a manager from both personal and organizational standpoints. In the case of the former, these include personal investment, personal growth, recognition, and achievement. On the organizational level, equity plays a critical role in impacting motivation since if there is a perception of inequity, then the disadvantaged workers will lose motivation. Dan Pink claims that there are also critically important and effective intrinsic motivators, such as autonomy, mastery, and purpose (TED, 2009). In addition, there are extrinsic motivational factors, such as financial incentives, promotions, and benefits that serve as tangible rewards for employees. These external rewards can significantly influence behavior by offering employees concrete goals to strive for. \n\nMoreover, a positive work environment and supportive leadership are crucial extrinsic factors that enhance motivation by fostering a sense of belonging and security within the workplace. When employees feel valued and supported, they are more likely to be engaged and productive. Balancing these intrinsic",
        "The choice of ship is connected with the running costs of transportation. Stopford (2009) claims that the best way to reduce costs is to select newer ships, which require fewer crewmembers, less maintenance, and are more reliable. While all of these points are true, they do not automatically make newer ships the preferable choice for shipping costs. As it stands, 65% of all cargo ships in the world are over 14 years old, meaning that competition for newer ships is intense (Cheng, 2021). High demand means increased costs, which was demonstrated by the increase in cargo rates in recent years due to limited availability of modern vessels.\n\nOlder ships, on the other hand, may offer a cost-effective alternative despite their age. They often have lower initial purchase prices and can still perform adequately with proper maintenance. Additionally, the implementation of retrofitting technologies can enhance their efficiency and reduce emissions, aligning them with newer environmental standards. Moreover, the availability of seasoned crews familiar with",
        "Goals and objectives outline desired outcomes and, thus, are often used interchangeably. However, the effect, timeframe, and specificity of the two terms set them apart. Nickels et al. (2019) define goals as broad and long-term outcomes that an organization seeks, while objectives define the measurable, specific, and short-term strategies for attaining the identified goal. For example, the criminal justice system uses goals to task the police, correctional agencies, and the court with the strategy to execute, including deterrence, rehabilitation, retribution, restoration, and incapacitation. Therefore, understanding the distinction between goals and objectives is crucial for effectively implementing and evaluating criminal justice policies.\n\nIn the realm of law enforcement, for instance, the overarching goal might be to reduce crime rates within a community. To achieve this, specific objectives could include increasing neighborhood patrols, engaging in community outreach programs, and implementing crime prevention workshops. While the goal provides a broad vision, these objectives offer clear, actionable steps that can",
        "Environment-friendly technologies develop with the growing social awareness about the issues caused by pesticides utilization in various industries. Sharma et al. (2020) claim that \u201cthese chemicals enter the ecosystem, thus hampering the sensitive environmental equilibrium through bio-accumulation\u201d (p. 110812). Consequently, alternative strategies become in demand for protecting the plants and species from biomagnification and severe changes in natural settings (Sharma et al., 2020). Biological, semi-chemical, and physical control methods for decreasing the use of pesticides require proper encouragement to achieve sustainable improvement in the ecological landscape.\n\nBiological control, involving the use of natural predators to manage pest populations, offers a promising path toward reducing chemical dependencies. Similarly, semi-chemical methods, such as pheromone traps, disrupt pest reproduction cycles without harming other species. Physical control techniques, including barriers and traps, provide direct intervention without chemical use. These approaches not only safeguard ecosystems but also contribute to the health of human populations by minimizing exposure to",
        "Motivation is the process whereby an individual's endeavors are stimulated, guided, and maintained toward achieving a goal. Thus, the responsibility of management is to monitor and direct workers in a company (Usmonovich, 2021). This is required since it is a method of inducing individuals to work, which they are capable and equipped to do freely. Even though most people have to work for a livelihood and a job is an essential part of everyone's lives, administrators must be apprehensive about employee motivation concerns for various reasons. Managers have several valid reasons to be concerned about motivating employees. Firstly, motivated employees tend to exhibit higher productivity levels, which directly contributes to the organizational success and competitive edge. When employees are enthusiastic about their tasks, they apply greater diligence and creativity, leading to improved efficiency and innovation.\n\nSecondly, motivation is closely linked to employee retention. A workplace that fosters motivation reduces turnover rates, saving the organization considerable costs associated with hiring and training new staff. Furthermore, a motivated workforce enhances workplace morale,",
        "Feminist ethics is founded on the views that women's subordination is morally inappropriate and that women's moral experiences are as valuable as men's. Vaughn (2019) states that the following are the practical aims of feminist ethics. Firstly, feminist ethics express moral critiques of behaviors and attitudes that reinforce women's rights. Consequently, the vital goal is to provide morally reasonable means to oppose such behaviors and practices. Ultimately, feminist ethics' objective is to imagine a morally good alternative that promotes female empowerment. Feminist ethical argument resurfaced in the late 1960s, first among the general public and then in academic circles, as scholars began to recognize the pervasive nature of gender inequality across various spheres of life. This resurgence was fueled by the broader women's rights movement, which called for a reevaluation of traditional ethical frameworks that historically marginalized women's voices and experiences. Feminist ethics challenges the conventional moral theories that often overlook or undervalue the complexity of women's lived experiences. It emphasizes the importance of context, relationships, and emotional responses in moral reasoning, rather than solely relying on abstract principles that may inadvertently perpetuate gender biases.\n\nThe practical application of feminist ethics seeks to dismantle patriarchal structures and promote gender equality by advocating for policies and practices that empower women. This involves not only critiquing existing inequalities but also constructing new ethical paradigms that reflect a more inclusive and equitable society. Moreover, feminist ethics encourages a rethinking of concepts such as justice, care, and autonomy from a perspective that values diversity and inclusivity. By doing so, it aims to create a world where all individuals, regardless of gender, can",
        "The concept of culture is a fundamental phenomenon influencing all spheres of human life. It influences people's actions, methods, and approaches toward specific tasks and daily interactions. Thus, Roseberry determines culture as a socially constructed and socially constitutive part of the context where all activities take place. It means that all other fundamental institutions and phenomena, such as power, economy, and history, comprise the culture. At the same time, being the way of life, it influences the mentioned spheres and preconditions for the emergence of critical processes in these domains. In other words, peculiarities of culture influence how societies evolve and adapt over time, impacting the development of laws, social norms, and educational systems.\n\nThis cultural framework serves as a lens through which individuals perceive their world, shaping their identity and values. For instance, culture affects economic activities by determining consumer behavior and market trends; it directs political structures by molding governance models and public policy preferences. Moreover, it influences historical narratives by deciding which events are commemorated and how",
        "In the modern world, diverse communities exist that support families in situations of emergency or need. Such support should be granted as sometimes families cannot manage their problems alone. Many communities provide families with support in diverse areas such as foster care, early childhood care, education, and homeless services (Fuss et al., 2021). For example, during the pandemics of COVID-19 many families experienced financial problems due to the ubiquitous job loss. Many such families could not cover their medical costs or even afford to buy normal food. Several organizations help families by caring about their young children or teenagers, ensuring that they continue to receive proper education and nutrition despite the hardships faced by their parents. These community-driven efforts are crucial, as they offer a safety net that can prevent families from spiraling into deeper crises.\n\nMoreover, the psychological support provided by community groups cannot be underestimated. Families dealing with health crises, financial instability, or the stress of uncertain futures benefit from counseling and mental health services. These services often help",
        "Social media has become an integral part of the modern world, considering that many people opt to use these platforms to interact with others. Personally, I prefer to use Facebook as it is not flooded with spam and advertisement as much as Instagram, Tik Tok, or similar apps. I use Facebook to interact with my old friends, who I can no longer see because they moved to other cities or even countries, so this social platform seems a perfect option to interact with them from time to time. However, mainstream social media applications appear to have influenced today's society since people are constantly exposed to hate, misinformation, and unrealistic standards. The prevalent use of social media platforms has created an environment where users, particularly young individuals, are vulnerable to the pressures of idealized lifestyles and appearances. This exposure can lead to issues such as anxiety, depression, and reduced self-esteem, as individuals compare their own lives to the carefully curated images and narratives they encounter online.\n\nMoreover, the rapid spread of misinformation through social media can have severe consequences. False narratives and conspiracy theories are often shared more widely than verified information, leading to misunderstandings and societal division. The echo chamber effect, where users are only exposed to information that aligns with their existing beliefs, further exacerbates this issue, reducing the likelihood of constructive dialogue and critical thinking.\n\nDespite these challenges, social media also has the potential to foster positive connections and community engagement. It can serve as a platform for raising awareness on important issues and mobilizing collective action. Therefore, while social media offers valuable opportunities for connection and information sharing, it is crucial for users to engage",
        "The airline industry has been hit particularly hard by Covid 19. The virus outbreak has caused the governments of most countries to implement restrictions on traveling (Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aviation, 2022). Thus, the regulatory implementations have negatively affected the standard revenue, business practices, and practices of airline companies. First, passengers were less keen to travel due to the testing regulations, limited resources, and the lack of need to travel for work. Another cause was the regulation themselves that implied a reduction in Covid-19 cases through quarantine measures. The low demand has caused the airlines to significantly reduce their operations, leading to decreased flight frequencies and, in some cases, the suspension of entire routes. This downturn in activity resulted in massive financial losses, forcing many airlines to seek governmental assistance to stay afloat. Layoffs and furloughs became rampant as companies struggled to manage costs amidst declining revenues.\n\nMoreover, the pandemic accelerated the shift towards digitalization within the industry. Airlines began to enhance their online platforms, offering flexible booking options and contactless check-in processes to adapt to the new normal. Despite these efforts, the recovery has been slow, with many travelers still hesitant to return to the skies due to lingering health concerns and the unpredictability of future restrictions.\n\nIn response, airlines have had to rethink their business models, focusing on sustainable practices and exploring alternative revenue streams. The crisis has underscored the industry's vulnerability to global disruptions, prompting a reevaluation of operational strategies to ensure resilience in the face of future challenges. As the world gradually emerges from the pandemic, the airline industry",
        "There are multiple factors that stand behind the successful implementation of the P-O-L-C framework. It is important to prioritize some of them duly in case a company faces serious issues, or when the market indicates upcoming challenges. The collapse of WorldCom in 2002, that led to one of the largest accounting scandals in the US, provides a nice example of the lack of proper communication in a corporation. The inability of various top managers and accountants to communicate efficiently in order to prevent frauds is always disastrous. WorldCom grew rapidly under Bernard Ebbers who managed to jump at the multiple opportunities of the telecommunications boom. However, the company's downfall was precipitated by a failure to adhere to the principles of the Planning, Organizing, Leading, and Controlling (P-O-L-C) framework.\n\nPlanning was deficient as WorldCom prioritized aggressive expansion over sustainable growth. Organizing suffered from a lack of internal checks and balances, allowing fraudulent accounting practices to flourish unchecked. The leadership failed to foster an ethical culture,",

        "It is important to note that the decision-making process is a complex and highly intricate activity, which involves the accuracy of the information, a clear vision of objectives, and an understanding of the underlying issues. Errors in the decision-making process are common and can be done by any manager. However, there is a clear distinction between a bad decision and a wrong decision. In the case of the latter, the decision is the result of reliance on false or inaccurate information with the best intentions to make a correct choice. When it comes to a bad decision, a manager is aware of and has chosen to disregard critical information or ethical considerations, often leading to negative consequences. \n\nThis distinction underscores the importance of diligence and ethical responsibility in leadership roles. A wrong decision might stem from data inaccuracies or unforeseen variables, and while regrettable, it is often deemed an unavoidable aspect of managerial tasks. Conversely, a bad decision reflects a lapse in judgment, where the manager consciously overlooks essential data or ethical standards, potentially due to personal",

It is believed that this aspect in the form of actions of social agents is of particular importance. This is because they occupy a central place in such processes as the formation of alliances and the establishment of dominance relations. Understanding this concept can give a better understanding of the creation of Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India. First, it is necessary to understand what a social strategy of power is and what significance it has. Thus, it is defined as a particular area where individuals, groups, or institutions leverage cultural, economic, and political resources to establish authority and influence.\n\nIn Western Europe, the feudal system was a social strategy where lords and vassals engaged in mutual obligations that solidified power.

        "Culture is the entirety of social norms, behaviors, and customs which distinguish a certain society from the rest of the world. Naturally, some cultures have common features, thus forming cultural clusters. At the same time, leadership is a personality trait that transcends national boundaries. This does not imply that all people with power behave in the same manner, as leaders are also influenced by cultural norms. Behavior differences are evident in the way people in different clusters view time. Middle Eastern cultures are frequently juxtaposed to Western ones, particularly American. Beehner writes that while \u201cmost Middle Eastern nations prioritize relationships and view time as fluid, seeing deadlines as flexible,\u201d Western cultures, such as that of the United States, often emphasize punctuality and rigid scheduling. This dichotomy in time perception illustrates how cultural norms intricately shape leadership styles and decision-making processes.\n\nIn Middle Eastern societies, leadership is often characterized by a strong emphasis on interpersonal connections and the cultivation of trust. Leaders are expected to invest time in building relationships, as personal bonds can significantly influence negotiations and decision-making. This approach reflects the broader cultural value placed on community and mutual respect, where the quality of relationships can outweigh the urgency of time.\n\nConversely, Western leadership tends to prioritize efficiency, productivity, and the strict adherence to schedules. In the American context, leaders are often seen as results-oriented, with a focus on meeting deadlines and achieving goals within set timeframes. This reflects a cultural prioritization of individualism and achievement, where time is viewed as a commodity to be managed meticulously.\n\nUnderstanding these cultural variances in leadership and",
        "The suggested strategies to mitigate the effects of coronavirus in accordance with the example of Iceland could be considered as an interesting approach. This strategy acknowledges its apparent limitations, such as the resilience of the Icelandic community and geographical idiosyncrasy. However, currently, this strategy might not be a valid method to address the high margins of infected individuals in NATO countries. It is certainly true that quick response and high testing rates would contribute to the deterrence of the effects imposed by the sudden growth of the number of infected. However, it is similarly meaningful that the population would be willing to undergo such a measure.\n\nIceland\u2019s approach was characterized by widespread testing, robust contact tracing, and transparent communication, all facilitated by its small population and cohesive community spirit.

In such conditions, competent and high-quality change management and decision-making are essential. In an age of global transformation, change management has become one of the principal success factors for most companies. The surrounding reality is in a state of constant flux, driven by technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences, and economic fluctuations.\n\nOrganizations that master change management can maintain their competitive edge by fostering an adaptive culture.

        "The two American regions to be first settled by the English colonists were New England and the Chesapeake Bay. In the Chesapeake Bay, the colonists arrived under the auspices of Virginia Company \u2013 a joint-stock enterprise dedicated to colonizing America for profit. Although the early hopes of finding precious metals did not materialize, the region eventually found its economic specialization in growing tobacco (Corbett et al., 2022). The company hired the English poor for the labor-intensive task of growing the colony and producing tobacco, and most of the newcomers were young single males (Corbett et al., 2022). In contrast, the settlers in New England, arriving primarily for religious reasons, established communities centered around family and faith. Unlike the Chesapeake, where economic gain was the primary driver, New England's societal structure was heavily influenced by a shared religious conviction and a desire for communal living.\n\nThe harsh climate and rocky soil in New England were not conducive to cash crops like tobacco. Instead, the region developed a mixed economy based on small-scale agriculture, fishing, and trade. The town meetings and congregational church structures promoted a sense of democracy and community involvement that would later influence the political evolution of the United States.\n\nThese fundamental differences in motivation, economic focus, and social structure between the New England and Chesapeake colonies created distinct regional identities. While the Chesapeake Bay focused on profit and individual gain, New England emphasized religion and community. These contrasting beginnings laid the foundation for the diverse cultural and economic landscape of future America, demonstrating how initial motives and environmental conditions can shape societal development for generations.",

This Swedish company has gained renown for the quality, accessibility, and innovativeness of its products. First of all, the firm's pricing strategy is focused on offering affordable yet stylish furniture that appeals to a broad demographic. By keeping costs low through efficient supply chain management, flat-pack packaging, and bulk purchasing, IKEA ensures that its products remain within reach for the average consumer.

        "\u201cFences\u201d by American playwright August Wilson was published in 1987. This play is about an elderly scavenger Troy, a basketball star in his youth. It is worth mentioning that \u201cFences\u201d contains many essential topics for discussion which are relevant nowadays. For instance, the first scene reveals the duties and responsibilities of fathers and sons. There are many interpretations of \u201cFences,\u201d including staged and filmed versions, and it is important to discuss both to understand their features. The spectator sees James Earl Jones in the role of a strict father. His performance as Troy Maxson in the original Broadway production captured the complexity of a man grappling with his past and the limitations imposed by a racially divided society. Jones's portrayal highlighted Troy's deep-seated frustrations and his struggle to provide for his family while being haunted by unfulfilled dreams. This theatrical interpretation emphasized the raw emotional intensity of Troy's character, bringing to light the generational conflicts between him and his son Cory, who represents a new era of opportunity and change.\n\nIn contrast, the 2016 film adaptation directed by Denzel Washington, who also played Troy, offered a more nuanced exploration of the domestic sphere and the intimate dynamics within the Maxson household. Washington's portrayal added layers of vulnerability to Troy's character, emphasizing his internal battles and the love beneath his stern exterior. The cinematic medium allowed for a more detailed setting, enriching the narrative with visual symbolism, such as the fence itself, which serves as both a physical and metaphorical barrier.\n\nBoth interpretations underscore themes of familial duty,",
        "Levels of culture can be displayed in different planes and depths. According to Edgar Shein, who developed the concept \u2018levels of organizational culture,' and Edward Granter who later expanded on this concept, the culture of the entity can be seen in four levels: super-structural, symbolic, discursive, and cognitive (Granter, 2019). In other words, the levels of culture in enterprises are developed due to external economic and social influences, artifacts such as logos, story rituals and events, values explicitly expressed by the organization, and underlying assumptions. This paper aims to assess the multifaceted nature of organizational culture through the lens of these levels, highlighting how they interact to shape the dynamics within a workplace. The super-structural level represents the overarching economic and social frameworks that influence an organization's orientation. These frameworks are often dictated by external factors such as market trends and societal norms, providing a backdrop against which the organization operates.\n\nThe symbolic level encompasses the tangible artifacts, such as logos, branding elements, and traditional rituals, that convey the identity and ethos of the organization. These symbols serve as a bridge between the organization and its stakeholders, reinforcing its core values.\n\nMoving deeper, the discursive level pertains to the narratives and stories that are articulated within and about the organization. These narratives not only reflect the organization's values but also shape employee behavior and public perception.\n\nFinally, the cognitive level consists of the underlying assumptions and beliefs that are often unspoken but guide organizational behavior and decision-making. These deep-seated assumptions influence how employees perceive their roles and their interactions with others.\n\nIn conclusion",

These include the desire to succeed from an academic and professional perspective, financial reasons, a lack of natural desires, and the understanding that a child would not enhance their life but rather make it more difficult (Sandler). There were a couple of things that I can't entirely agree with. The choice of a woman to be in a serious relationship with a man with a 15-year-old daughter without taking even minimal parental responsibilities appears to be inconsiderate for the young girl both from the perspective of the childfree woman and the child herself.\n\nA fundamental aspect of forming a relationship with someone who has children is acknowledging the existing family dynamics. Ignoring this can inadvertently communicate neglect and indifference to the child, who is at a critical developmental stage.

The US invasion of Cuba became evident when the USS \u201cMaine\u201d sank under mysterious conditions in the waters of Havana. Around the same time, in February 1898, hasty preparations for war began, while the Spaniards were accused in absentia of undermining the battleship (Mortenson & Springer, 2019). In general, one can talk about a long-term political game with Spain, in which several provocations and strategic maneuvers set the stage for conflict.\n\nThe United States had vested economic interests in Cuba, and the Spanish mismanagement of the island posed a continuous obstacle. The explosion of the Maine served as a catalyst, igniting public outrage and fueling the expansionist agenda of American policymakers. The sensationalist press, driven by figures such as William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, capitalized on the incident to",

        "The issue of tribal sovereignty has been scrutinized over the years, the treatment of tribes ranging from supportive measures and attempts of integration into the broader community to outright persecution. In this connection, the law about tribal gaming can be seen as a positive step towards recognition of tribes' unique way of life and self-determination. This essay discusses the question \u201chow tribal gaming act can add to the sovereignty of tribes?\u201d Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes were given the right to determine what gaming activities they wanted to engage in, and in most cases, the permission was granted by the federal government, which marked a significant shift in the recognition of tribal authority.\n\nThe ability to regulate gaming activities has empowered tribes economically, providing much-needed revenue that supports community development and tribal government operations. This financial independence enhances their sovereignty by reducing reliance on federal or state funds. Additionally, gaming operations have created jobs within tribal lands, further strengthening their economic base. Beyond economics, the Act reinforces cultural autonomy by allowing tribes to govern",
        "Developing a contract so that all parties involved could be aware of their obligations and meet them accordingly is one of the vital tasks for an organization. Charles Schwab, an organization offering banking and brokerage services, has developed a contract for its users to sign so that both parties could meet the respective requirements (Reder et al., 2021). For their collaboration. Since the contract in question contains the essential components of a legal agreement, it can be considered viable. Starting with the key definitions of the foundational concepts on which the agreement is based, Schwab's contract establishes the offer, acceptance, and consideration necessary for forming a binding agreement. This structured approach ensures that all parties understand their rights and responsibilities, thus fostering a transparent and trust-based relationship. For example, the contract delineates the specifics of Schwab's services, detailing the scope of brokerage and banking functions, thereby setting clear expectations for clients.\n\nFurthermore, Schwab's contract outlines the procedures for handling disputes, which is crucial in maintaining a harmonious business relationship. By providing a predefined process for conflict resolution, the organization minimizes potential disruptions, allowing for continuous and efficient operations.\n\nThe incorporation of privacy and data protection clauses is another critical aspect of Schwab's contract. In an era marked by increasing cyber threats, safeguarding clients' personal and financial information is paramount. By explicitly stating how client data will be used and protected, Schwab not only complies with legal standards but also builds trust with its clientele.\n\nIn conclusion, the comprehensive nature of Schwab's contract serves as a model for other organizations aiming to establish robust legal agreements.

        "The study showed that bibliometric analysis of evidence gathered from integrative reviews and analytical studies had substantial implications for nurse-related and evidence-based policy changes. Primarily, this is possible through the use of integrative reviews in designing new programs (Benton et al., 2020). The collective database of the synthesized studies as suggested by the authors of the study, can be utilized by nurses to be empowered through evidence-based materials in the formulation of changes in universal health coverage. As such, the applicability of this information has a number of benefits for working nurses, as they will be equipped with the latest research and data to influence healthcare policies effectively.\n\nBy leveraging this comprehensive pool of knowledge, nurses are positioned to advocate for practices that are rooted in the most current and reliable evidence. This empowerment not only enhances the quality of patient care but also contributes to the professional development of nurses, fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement. Furthermore, evidence-based policy changes informed by integrative reviews can lead to more efficient healthcare",
        "There is no simple answer to what it means to be human. Some might say that being human means being independent and controlling their personal lives. For other people, being human means utilizing the refinements of civilization, wearing clothes, and going to work every day, i.e., doing everything that animals cannot do. It is also complicated to say how people want to live because everyone has unique requirements, dreams, and thoughts on this issue. This essay reflects on the On Being podcast and answers the above questions. In the podcast, Thich Nhat Hanh explains why people need to be connected to themselves and others to truly embrace their humanity.\n\nThich Nhat Hanh, a renowned Buddhist monk, emphasizes the importance of mindfulness and interconnectedness, suggesting that human beings thrive when they cultivate compassion and understanding. He argues that being human involves recognizing our shared existence and fostering a deep connection with the world around us. This approach challenges the notion of independence as the ultimate human trait, instead highlighting empathy and community",
        "Unemployment is a significant social and economic problem. Not always positive aspects of enterprise development contribute to a decrease in the percentage of unemployed. The negative impact may be cumulative along with phenomena such as inflation and external factors, including the pandemic. Difficulties in obtaining an education for low-income families only widen the gap between the rich and the poor, which in America is already the largest in the world (Telford, 2019). Consequently, the leading causes of unemployment are inflation, advanced technology, and lack of education or skills for employment. Inflation drives up prices in the economy, eroding the purchasing power of consumers and increasing the cost of living. As businesses face higher operational costs, they may reduce their workforce to maintain profitability, exacerbating unemployment.\n\nMoreover, rapid technological advancements, while driving productivity, often render certain jobs obsolete. Automation and artificial intelligence, for instance, replace roles that were once labor-intensive, leaving workers scrambling to adapt in a dynamically evolving job market. This technological displacement can be",

Lia Thomas, a first-time competitor in the women's division, had a strong showing. Early in December, she had her greatest college results of the year in Ohio, when she competed in the two hundred and five hundred meter sprints. After Lia Thomas' successes at university swimming pools, she was criticized following the fact that she was born a male, which gave her an advantage. Some people argued that because Thomas was taking testosterone therapy, her hormone levels were within the range deemed fair for female athletes, allowing her to compete legitimately according to NCAA regulations.\n\nThis debate highlights the complex intersection of gender identity and competitive fairness in sports. Critics argue that physiological advantages remain, despite hormone regulation, and advocate for revised rules to ensure equitable competition. Supporters emphasize the importance of inclusivity and the right of transgender athletes to compete in alignment with their gender identity.\n\n",
        "Outreach Chicago is an organization providing help and services to homeless people and those underserved by already existing incorporations. The company's main mission is to provide help and necessities to humans for their subsequent successful reintegration into society. To practice deductive reasoning, it is essential to start by formulating a general hypothesis or statement that Outreach Chicago provides help to people (Adler & Clark, 2015). The observation allows us to find evidence for the statement as Outreach Chicago serves meals and distributes hygiene kits, coats, blankets, socks, and undergarments to people in need.\n\nBy addressing the immediate needs of the homeless, Outreach Chicago establishes a foundation for more extensive societal reintegration efforts. The distribution of essential items is not merely a charitable act; it acts as a catalyst for change, alleviating immediate distress and paving the way for long-term solutions. This approach is grounded in the understanding that meeting basic human needs is a prerequisite for addressing more complex social issues like employment and housing stability.\n\nMoreover, Outreach Chicago",
        "The healthcare industry typically draws sufficient attention to patients' education, especially when it comes to representatives of minority groups. That is why the article by McCurley et al. (2017) offers valuable information. The researchers demonstrate that Hispanic individuals deal with improved diabetes prevention when they participate in individual and group face-to-face sessions (McCurley et al., 2017). I believe that there is an apparent reason why such positive outcomes are achieved. It seems that face-to-face interventions are effective because patients have an opportunity to ask questions if they require explanations. Simultaneously, such interactions foster a sense of community and belonging, which are crucial for minority groups who might otherwise feel marginalized or overlooked within the healthcare system. By engaging in these personalized settings, Hispanic individuals can connect with others who share their experiences and cultural backgrounds, thereby enhancing motivation and adherence to preventive health measures.\n\nMoreover, face-to-face sessions often allow healthcare providers to tailor their communication and interventions to suit the cultural nuances of their patients. This cultural competence is essential, as it ensures that the information provided is relevant and sensitive to the specific needs and values of the community. It helps in breaking down potential language barriers and misunderstandings that could arise in more generalized healthcare settings.\n\nAnother critical aspect of these sessions is the opportunity they provide for immediate feedback and support, which can be particularly empowering for patients. When individuals understand how their behaviors and lifestyle choices directly impact their health outcomes, they are more likely to take proactive steps towards prevention.\n\nIn conclusion, the success of face-to-face interventions in diabetes prevention among Hispanic individuals, as",
        "Since it is assumed that skiing is a rather traumatic sport, the company should have taken precautions for minimizing the injury risks for the skiers. However, in that particular case, the actions of the company's workers have created risks for health damage for Mr. Craig and Mr. Alex, who were actually injured. The fact that it was April and the slopes were supposed to be closed may lessen the degree of the company's responsibility in this particular case, but not completely. The company made a mistake letting people ski after the snowstorm though it could not have allowed people to do it.\n\nSkiing is inherently risky, demanding strict safety protocols and vigilant oversight from ski resort operators. In the incident involving Mr. Craig and Mr. Alex, the company's failure to enforce closure of the slopes despite adverse weather conditions highlights a significant oversight in safety management. The decision to allow skiing post-snowstorm, when conditions were unpredictable and potentially hazardous, demonstrates negligence. Although April typically signals the end of the ski season, resorts",
        "Service marketing is usually defined as a promotion of an intangible good or a service to a particular segment of the audience. It is distinguished from product marketing by such features as Inseparability, Heterogeneity, Intangibility, and Perishability. This paper will focus on the last characteristic, perishability, which implies the impossibility of any storage or repeated use of the service. In case the service is not used, it is most likely to be lost forever (Hole et al., 2018). Examples of such can be a concert or a sports event. Sometimes they can be canceled either due to unforeseen circumstances like inclement weather or logistical issues, leading to a direct loss of potential revenue.\n\nThe perishability aspect of service marketing poses unique challenges in terms of maximizing revenue and consumer satisfaction. For instance, unsold tickets to a concert or unbooked hotel rooms represent a missed opportunity for income. Businesses must therefore employ strategic marketing and pricing tactics to minimize these losses. Techniques such as",
        "Care ethics theory was thoroughly criticized based on the concept of slave morality. This idea was developed by Nietzsche and declares that discriminated people often create the mindset that enables them to treat their forced servant behavior as a kind of virtuous manners (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, n.d.). Thus, the urge and readiness to provide care are viewed not as a positive trait but lowliness that only strengthens oppression. The other criticism of care ethics lies in the notion that provided help is often parochial. Namely, the caregivers prefer their relatives, friends, and the citizens of their country over other people who may be in greater need but fall outside their immediate network of concern. This localized focus can lead to an imbalance in the distribution of care, undermining the universal applicability that ethical theories aim to achieve. Critics argue that such a limited view may perpetuate social injustices by neglecting those who are not directly connected to the caregiver, thus reinforcing societal divisions.\n\nFurthermore, care ethics is critiqued for potentially",
        "Scott Kiesling focuses on the address term dude in the article Dude (2004), whereby the term's pattern of use, meanings, and functions are highlighted. The author is an American sociolinguist prompted to research dude's functions and implications in the American culture by his undying interests in gender and language. Dude portrays a specific pattern of use influenced by its societal functions and meanings, thus explaining its high usage and enhanced popularity. Dude is mostly used by the younger generation of European American men when addressing one another and partly by women. Kiesling (2004) reports that this term has evolved beyond a simple label of addressing peers, serving as a tool for managing social dynamics and expressing solidarity. Its versatility allows it to function in multiple contexts, such as a marker of relaxed masculinity, a method of conveying camaraderie, or even as a tool for diffusing tension. The term avoids overly formal or intimate connotations, providing a neutral yet friendly interactional tone.\n\nDude's ability to",
        "Aristotle made a discovery fundamental to all logic by introducing variables. Thus, it was shown that logic is not just a specific doctrine of specific things or terms, but the science of the laws of syllogisms, such as modus ponens or modus tollens, expressed in variables. Studying various judgments, formal logic abstracts from their specific content, revealing a structure common to objects of different content. Syllogism is the discovery of Aristotle and is the main and most original part of his logic. In the theory of syllogisms, Aristotle defined a systematic approach to deducing valid conclusions from given premises, providing a framework that transcends the particulars of any situation.\n\nAristotle's innovation was to present a method in which logical reasoning could be applied universally, enabling the discernment of truth through structured argumentation. By introducing variables, he empowered thinkers to identify the underlying form of arguments, thus ensuring that sound reasoning could be replicated across various disciplines. His work laid the foundation for formal",
        "The current global landscape of the agricultural economy is composed of large companies. In fact, their presence is prevalent enough to dictate and formulate policies and standards within the industry (Chemnitz et al., 2017). In practice, this has resulted in a number of discrepancies such as environmental damages, violations of human and labor rights, and even the lack of effort to minimize poverty. While the scale of the issue may seem too large to resolve, alterations of consumer buying habits have the potential to foster diversity within such industries. However, buying habits are only a small fragment of a number of interventions that are necessary to effectively address the challenges posed by the dominance of large agricultural corporations. Governments must implement stricter regulations to ensure environmental sustainability and protect the rights of workers within the agricultural sector. Policies that promote the fair distribution of resources and encourage small-scale farming enterprises could mitigate the concentration of power in the hands of a few major players. Furthermore, education campaigns aimed at raising awareness about sustainable and ethical consumption can empower consumers to make informed choices that support fair practices.\n\nIn addition to policy and consumer-driven changes, technological advancements can play a crucial role. Innovations in agricultural technology can help smaller farmers increase productivity and compete more effectively. By providing support through training and access to cutting-edge tools, we can foster an environment where diverse farming practices thrive.\n\nCollectively, these efforts can diminish the grip of large corporations on the agricultural economy, paving the way for a more equitable and sustainable future. While it is a complex and multifaceted challenge, coordinated actions across various sectors have the potential to reshape the agricultural landscape, ensuring that it",

In the novel, Mr. Das sparks both sympathy and a sense of slight annoyance that is likely to transform into disdain after considering the evolution of his character. Although the character might seem benevolent and sympathetic at first, his evident inability to emotionally connect with his wife or children indicates the need for further evolution, which never occurs. At first glance, Mr. Das represents a character that is easy to empathize with and relate to due to his kind nature. Indeed, Mr. Das is portrayed as an affable and easygoing figure, perhaps mirroring the everyday individual engrossed in the minutiae of daily life.\n\nHowever, the veneer of his character is quickly shattered by his emotional detachment and passive presence within his family. This detachment is epitomized in his obliviousness to the underlying tensions and needs of his family members. Rather than addressing these issues, Mr. Das remains ensconced in",
        "In a narrow sense, the \u201czero-sum story\u201d is a belief that there is a competition between racial groups, and any progress for one group is a threat to the resources and position of another (McGhee). This story is the mainstream paradigm for conservative media and has been told in different forms for years. The negative impacts of the \u201czero-sum\u201d paradigm on the United States are massive and diverse. This mindset created additional economic, political, and social costs for all citizens of the United States. One of the prominent examples demonstrated by McGhee is the dismantling of public swimming pools across the United States during the mid-20th century. As integration efforts began to open these public spaces to African Americans, many cities chose to close or even destroy their pools rather than allow them to be shared by people of different races. This decision was a clear manifestation of the zero-sum mindset, where the perceived racial progress was seen as a direct threat to white privilege and social status.\n\nThe closure of public amenities such as swimming pools did not just harm African American communities; it deprived all citizens of valuable public resources that fostered social cohesion and community well-being. This exemplifies how the zero-sum narrative, while ostensibly protecting the interests of one group, ultimately leads to collective loss. Economically, this mindset fosters policies that prioritize short-term gains for select groups over long-term national prosperity. Politically, it fuels divisive rhetoric that undermines democratic processes and weakens social trust. Socially, it perpetuates stereotypes and racial tensions,",
        "One of the key aspects of the assessment includes risk analysis and goal setting, both of which enable a clearer direction and more detailed as well as the focused planning process. The video provides an insightful demonstration of how risk assessment and goal setting are conducted when dealing with a client. The assessment session begins with the risk assessment process, where a counselor asks a client whether or not he or she has suicidal thoughts. Regardless of the answer, the video shows that the counselor asks the client to report if she will start having such inclinations (Dr. Todd Grande, 2016). A similar structure is applied to assessing other areas of the client's life, such as financial stability, employment, and personal relationships. By identifying potential risks in these areas, the counselor can better understand the challenges the client faces and develop a comprehensive plan to address them. This proactive approach ensures that both short-term and long-term goals are realistic and achievable.\n\nThe video further illustrates the importance of setting specific, measurable objectives that align with the client's values and aspirations. By working collaboratively, the counselor and client can prioritize goals and create a step-by-step plan to achieve them. This not only increases the client's motivation but also provides a roadmap for progress.\n\nMoreover, the video underscores the necessity of regular follow-ups and adjustments to the plan as needed. Life is dynamic, and unforeseen challenges can arise, requiring flexibility in the approach. The counselor's role is to support the client through these changes, ensuring they stay on track towards their desired outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, risk analysis and goal setting are crucial components of effective counseling. They provide a structured framework",
        "The 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was introduced in the second half of the 19th century, manifesting the abolition of slavery across the country. According to the text, every citizen of the U.S. can neither enslave people nor be enslaved by fellow U.S. residents regardless of gender, race, age, or any other characteristic (U.S. Const. amend. 13, \u00a7 1). The abolition of slavery across the state has impacted U.S. history and the life of every American citizen, as this process initiated the restoration of individual freedom and laid the groundwork for ongoing civil rights movements. By prohibiting slavery, the amendment symbolized a pivotal shift in the nation\u2019s moral and social fabric, acknowledging the inherent dignity and equality of all individuals.\n\nThis transformative change was not merely a legal adjustment but a profound cultural evolution that challenged deeply ingrained social norms. The amendment's passage marked a significant victory in the struggle for racial equality, providing a legal foundation",
        "Overpopulation in cities has become one of the most critical problems of our time. This is both an environmental and a social problem. The city cannot grow indefinitely and provide decent workplaces for every resident. The ecological burden is also increasing. Uncontrolled growth in the number of cities leads to the unchecked spread of pollution and the escalation of poverty. However, there are several preventive measures that the Government can implement to combat this problem. First of all, overpopulation in cities is congestion and traffic jams, which lead to serious pollution problems. Atmospheric pollution is the most serious in cities, and its primary source is vehicular emissions. As more people flock to urban areas, the number of cars on the roads multiplies, exacerbating air quality and contributing to climate change. To mitigate this, governments can invest in sustainable public transportation systems that reduce reliance on personal vehicles. Expanding subway networks, improving bus systems, and promoting cycling can significantly decrease traffic congestion and lower pollution levels.\n\nAdditionally, urban planning policies should focus on creating more green spaces and promoting vertical living solutions. This not only helps in reducing pollution but also enhances the quality of life for city dwellers by providing cleaner air and recreational areas. Implementing strict regulations on industrial emissions and encouraging the use of renewable energy sources are also critical steps.\n\nSocially, overpopulation strains housing and increases the cost of living, pushing low-income residents into poorer conditions. Governments should invest in affordable housing projects and provide incentives for businesses to establish operations in less populated areas, thus distributing the population more evenly.\n\nIn conclusion, while the challenges of urban overpopulation are daunting,",

Clearly enough, it is impossible without a thorough understanding of a company's business environment. When it comes to entering the market with the goods for the purchasers' consumption, the one theory that specialists often take to is the supply and demand theory. This theory is utilized to understand the customers' buying behaviors and help managers strategize the product in the market in accordance with them. For instance, a lack of demand for a specific product often signals to leaders that there is a need to reassess the product's value proposition or pricing strategy. \n\nMarket leaders must adjust their approach to either stimulate demand through marketing campaigns or innovate the product to better meet consumer needs.

These writings can be on the second, third, and so on pages, depending on the pressure on the writing subject, that is, a pen or pencil. Even though such records are difficult to see, the examiners still have the experience and specialized equipment to ensure that this concealment was revealed. Indented writing is invisible indentations in the sheets of paper located under the page on which the information was written. This intriguing phenomenon often serves as a crucial piece of evidence in unraveling mysteries, adding a layer of complexity to the investigative process. In the world of detective fiction, the protagonist frequently discovers these hidden clues, showcasing their keen observation skills and relentless pursuit of truth. This technique highlights the meticulous nature of detective work, where every detail, no matter how faint or seemingly insignificant, can lead to significant breakthroughs.\n\nThe existence of indented writing underscores the importance of forensic science in crime-solving, demonstrating how modern technology aids in uncovering hidden truths. Tools like electrostatic detection apparatus (ESDA) allow investigators to visualize these invisible traces, making what was once unseen visible and readable. This capability emphasizes the narrative that justice, though sometimes obscured, can always be brought to light with perseverance and the right tools.\n\nMoreover, the presence of indented writing in detective stories and programs reflects the human fascination with secrets and hidden meanings.

However, this \u201cWestern model,\u201d according to Lerner, is, in fact, global. It acquired its name only due to a historical confluence of circumstances. Countries of the North Atlantic were the first to carry out significant societal transformations, which later became a universal blueprint for development.\n\nThe core of Lerner's argument is that modernization is an inevitable and linear process characterized by industrialization, urbanization, literacy, and media participation. These elements contribute to a more open and participant society. In the Middle Eastern context, the transition towards modernization is complex due to deep-rooted traditional structures and values. Nevertheless, the pull towards a modern state is strong",
        "Miranda warning, also known as Miranda rights, is a formal statement in which a person being arrested is informed of their basic civil rights under the jurisdiction of the United States. Through this warning, an officer of the law enforcement notifies the individual of their right to remain silent, as well as to an attorney. Such principles reflect the foundation of the legal system of the United States, in which both sides are protected by a comprehensive set of rights in order to eliminate bias and enable an objective investigation of the case. The obligatory nature of the warning serves the interests of both sides of the legal equation by ensuring that the accused is aware of their protections, thereby safeguarding against coerced confessions and unlawful interrogation practices.\n\nThe landmark Supreme Court case Miranda v. Arizona (1966) set the precedent for this critical safeguard, acknowledging the inherent power imbalance during custodial interrogations. By guaranteeing that individuals are informed of their rights, the legal system upholds the principle that justice must be administered fairly and without prejudice",
        "The editing in the first episode of the series Money Heist is in line with its thrilling plot and rapid action. In the first scene, as the character gets ready to exit her vehicle, the editing is quick, focusing on the items she is picking up. Similarly, the camera often focuses on objects, leading the viewer towards the items that will become an essential part of the narrative. For example, one can see the ringing phone before it is picked up. Moreover, the show uses rapid editing with close-ups and the use of objects that identify characters \u2013 guns, money, and other items of significance.\n\nThis meticulous attention to detail serves not only to build tension but also to immerse the audience deeply into the world of the heist. As scenes transition briskly, the viewer is coerced into a state of alertness, mirroring the characters\u2019 own heightened senses during the heist. This method of storytelling also establishes a rhythm that mirrors the urgency and stakes of the plot. By interweaving",
        "The concept of nursing is closely associated with the idea of continuous improvement, as the trends of health care need to mirror the existing social trends to provide the best care possible. One way to secure such care is to refer to the latest scholarly findings to modify the approaches to care provision in the workplace. This process of implementing research-based findings in daily patient care is known as evidence-based practice (EBP) (Wilson & Austria, 2021). Currently, EBP is not used actively by nurses for several reasons. First, the workload of most nurses discourages their desire to learn and embrace new methodologies. With demanding shifts and limited time for professional development, nurses often prioritize immediate clinical tasks over integrating novel approaches.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of access to current research and training opportunities further hinders the adoption of EBP. Many healthcare facilities still struggle with providing adequate resources and support systems that encourage EBP engagement. Moreover, a gap in knowledge persists among nurses regarding the practical application of research findings, which can",
        "Anorexia nervosa is a treatable eating disorder when people significantly limit the number of calories and types of foods they eat, which leads to excessive weight loss. Anyone may be affected by anorexia, and about 1-2% of the population suffers from the disorder (Cleveland Clinic Medical Staff, 2021). Key symptoms include: Emotional and mental signs: fear of gaining weight, obsession with counting calories or diets, irritability, self-criticism, and other characteristics. Behavioral signs: changes in eating habits, excessive exercise, and other features. Physical signs: weight loss, fatigue, dizziness, and gastrointestinal issues.\n\nThe impact of anorexia nervosa extends beyond the individual, affecting family, friends, and society at large. The complex interplay of genetic, biological, and environmental factors makes treatment challenging, yet hope remains. Early intervention significantly improves the prognosis, highlighting the importance of awareness and education.

        "Global climate change, as has now been proven by the latest research, is caused by human activity. Awareness of the seriousness of the situation is gradually penetrating into world public opinion. There is still an opportunity to mitigate the consequences to avoid the worst. People can all unite in order to change the situation, even though this process may be gradual and take some time. The main difficulty is connected with the extremely uneven distribution of greenhouse gas emissions between developed and developing countries, large and small. However, it is possible to change the situation by taking small steps. For instance, the population should use public transportation more frequently, reducing the reliance on personal vehicles that contribute significantly to carbon emissions.\n\nAdditionally, adopting renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power can provide cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels. Encouraging policies that support sustainable agriculture and deforestation prevention can also play a crucial role in capturing carbon and preserving biodiversity. Individuals can contribute by reducing waste, recycling, and supporting companies with sustainable practices.\n\nFurthermore, education and awareness",
        "Perspective is an important consideration in art, one that determines the way people look at a painting and what they see, how they see it, and how they interact with it. Additionally, it is responsible for the way people understand an image in its cultural context or intended meaning. While exploring the google arts and culture exhibit, I have been able to see a number of different religious paintings that use perspective in interesting ways. I think that the discussion of perspective is important for those both close and far from the art world, as it promotes engagement with paintings that can often be overlooked. To appreciate the full depth of a painting, one must consider not just the physical perspective, such as lines and vanishing points, but also the cultural and historical context that shapes its creation and perception. For instance, Renaissance artists revolutionized perspective by introducing linear perspective, creating a sense of depth and realism that drew viewers into the scene. This technique allowed religious paintings to convey divine narratives with a lifelike clarity that resonated deeply with viewers of the time.\n\nMoreover, cultural perspective plays a crucial role in interpreting art. A painting depicting a biblical scene, for instance, may hold different meanings for individuals from various cultural or religious backgrounds. Such diversity in interpretation enriches the dialogue around the artwork, highlighting its universal appeal and its capacity to evoke emotion and reflection across different cultures.\n\nBy engaging with paintings through diverse perspectives, both artistic and cultural, viewers can uncover layers of meaning, fostering a deeper appreciation and understanding. This engagement not only enhances personal experience but also bridges gaps between different communities, emphasizing art's",
        "Gendered behavior denotes fundamental expressions of gender socialization and identity through an individual's various developmental phases. Thus, gendered behaviors refer to the ways persons behave according to their respective male or female genders (Au & Rudolfsdottir, 2021). One of the prominent gendered behaviors instilled in me during childhood was that women are the primary cooks in the home. Hence, from childhood, I learned how to prepare food for the family, unlike most male relatives around. Even the movies mostly depicted women as the cooks in the home. Perhaps the gendered role that I quickly adopted was not solely influenced by direct teachings but also subtly reinforced by societal norms and media portrayals. As a child, I observed my mother and aunts tirelessly preparing meals, while male family members often remained in the living room. This division was mirrored in television shows and films, where female characters often donned aprons while engaging in kitchen activities, reinforcing the notion that cooking was inherently a woman's duty.\n\nThese early experiences significantly shaped my understanding of gender roles. I began associating domestic responsibilities with femininity, internalizing the belief that nurturing through food preparation was a natural extension of being female. As I matured, however, I encountered diverse perspectives that challenged these ingrained notions. Friends and educators introduced alternative viewpoints, showcasing men who were passionate about cooking and women who excelled in fields traditionally dominated by men.\n\nThis exposure prompted a reevaluation of my beliefs, leading me to question and critique the binary perception of gender roles. It became clear that the capacity to nurture, create, or lead",
        "Woman with a Parasol \u2013 Madame Monet and Her Son is a painting by the French artist Claude Monet, a founder and one of the most outstanding representatives of impressionism. Painted in 1875, this canvas became one of Monet's most well-known and influential works (Brodska\u00efa and Kalitina). The two figures in the painting are Monet's wife Camille and his son Jean. The lower third of the painting shows a grassy area, and the other two-thirds contain the figures of a woman and a little boy behind her. This composition not only highlights Monet\u2019s pioneering impressionist techniques but also encapsulates a serene, fleeting moment of family interaction.\n\nMonet masterfully uses light and color to convey the movement and immediacy of the scene. The painting captures a breezy afternoon, with Camille\u2019s veil and dress fluttering gently, adding a sense of dynamic motion. The vivid greens of the grass contrast beautifully against the whites and blues of the clothing and sky, illustrating Monet\u2019s",
        "In the development of nursing in Europe in the 19th century, the activities of an outstanding personality, the Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, played an important role. Florence was looking for an opportunity to help the poor and the sick. At that distant time, activities related to mercy, helping those in need, were considered an occupation not worthy of a noblewoman. The young woman sacrificed personal life expensive relationships with her parents but remained faithful to her calling. Furthermore, her values and commitment allowed Florence to become a historical figure in modern nursing, to whose leadership people owe accolades for paving the way for revolutionary reforms in healthcare.\n\nFlorence Nightingale's pioneering efforts during the Crimean War highlighted her profound impact on nursing. She introduced rigorous sanitation practices, drastically reducing mortality rates and setting a new standard for medical care. Her methodical approach to healthcare extended beyond battlefield hospitals; she established the Nightingale School of Nursing, which professionalized nursing education and empowered women to pursue careers in healthcare.\n\nHer legacy is profound",

        "In order to understand the structure and functions of society, it is essential to study a vast number of sociological theories and perspectives created by various scientists. For example, Emile Durkheim, a French sociologist, expressed his view of society in the theory of functionalism. According to Durkheim, there is vital interconnectivity of all the elements of any society that share common ideas and principles, and the sum of these elements is not as great as the society itself. The sociologist viewed society as a huge biological organism that requires all its parts to function properly in order to maintain stability and cohesion. This perspective emphasizes the importance of each component\u2014be it institutions, traditions, or norms\u2014in contributing to the overall health and functionality of society. Durkheim believed that social structures, much like organs in a body, perform distinct and necessary roles that ensure the survival and prosperity of the collective.\n\nThe functionalist approach allows for an understanding of social phenomena as integral parts of a larger system, explaining how different aspects of society work together to maintain order and equilibrium. Education, for instance, is not merely an institution for imparting knowledge, but also a mechanism for socializing individuals, preparing them for economic roles, and integrating diverse groups into a cohesive whole.\n\nBy focusing on the interdependence of societal components, functionalism provides insight into how societies adapt to changes and challenges. Despite criticisms for its conservative bias and tendency to overlook social inequalities, Durkheim's theory remains a foundational pillar in sociology, encouraging further exploration into how societies maintain stability and respond to internal and external pressures",
        "The case under consideration, Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S., was significant for developing measures to avoid discrimination in the workplace. More specifically, it was primarily related to diversity in terms of sex and age since this combination frequently evokes the concerns of the population (King, 2021). The examination of the issue by relying on the example of Gerald Bostock was advantageous for establishing proper employment practices in this respect. In this lawsuit filed by the plaintiff, the main factor was his unjustified dismissal from the company in which he had otherwise positive reputation. This event was pivotal in challenging entrenched biases against LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly in employment contexts.\n\nGerald Bostock's dismissal catalyzed a broader discussion on the interpretation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. The Supreme Court's ruling in favor of Bostock was groundbreaking, affirming that discrimination based",

Primarily, these professionals are office assistants filling out paperwork and interacting with staff (\u201cHow to become a medical office assistant,\u201d 2021). As a result, I will be approaching interviews for this job in a professional business style. While the fitting suit can be expensive, I already have the proper formal attire. Using my black formal suit, shoes, and minimal accessories, I can make the right impression without reducing my budget. In warm weather, I can opt for lighter fabrics while maintaining a professional appearance. Preparing for interviews extends beyond attire, though; understanding the responsibilities and expectations of the role is crucial. A medical office worker must be adept at juggling multiple tasks, from scheduling appointments to handling patient inquiries and maintaining accurate records.\n\nCommunication skills are paramount in this position, as it involves constant interaction with both healthcare professionals and patients. The ability to convey information clearly and empathetically can significantly impact the patient's experience and the overall efficiency of the office. Additionally, familiarity with medical terminology and office software is essential to navigate the daily tasks smoothly.\n\nTime management and organizational skills are equally important. With numerous appointments, billing tasks, and patient files to manage, a medical office worker must prioritize tasks effectively to ensure the smooth operation of the practice. By demonstrating these competencies during interviews, I can underline my readiness for the role.\n\nIn conclusion, preparing for a medical office worker position involves balancing professionalism in appearance with a deep understanding of the multifaceted responsibilities.

        "With the widespread use of digital technology, email has gained particular importance. With email, communication has become much easier, as people have been able to communicate with colleagues, relatives, loved ones, and business partners and representatives of organizations, literally in real-time, avoiding all the difficulties of \u201cphysical\u201d communication. However, what is interesting is a study of the extent to which such communication has been modified with the advent of the phenomenon of email. In the context of interpersonal communication, two effects should be highlighted. First, email has meaningfully broadened the scope of communication so that people can now maintain relationships across vast distances. This expansion has facilitated global connectivity, making it possible for individuals to sustain interactions with friends and family members who reside in different parts of the world without the need for costly travel. As a result, the concept of a global village has become more tangible, as geographical boundaries no longer pose significant barriers to maintaining personal and professional relationships.\n\nSecond, email has redefined the nature of written communication, emphasizing brevity and clarity. The immediacy of email encourages succinctness, as people have adapted to conveying their messages quickly and effectively to keep pace with the rapid exchanges characteristic of the digital age. This shift has influenced not only personal communication but also professional interactions, where clarity and efficiency are now paramount in business correspondence.\n\nDespite these advantages, the impersonal nature of email may sometimes lead to misunderstandings, as the absence of non-verbal cues can obscure the intended tone or emotion behind a message. Nevertheless, by complementing traditional communication methods, email continues to play a",
        "The concepts of domestic violence and abuse refer to psychologically or physically aggressive behavior of one family member towards another. This aggression could take the form of beating, rape, screaming, and humiliation. Unfortunately, in the modern world, these are common phenomena. According to statistics provided by Huecker et al.

Fear of the aggressor might force a victim to keep calm about the experience of being abused. Nonetheless, breaking the silence is crucial to reclaiming one's autonomy and initiating change.\n\nSupport systems and community resources play a vital role in empowering victims. Shelters, hotlines, and counseling services offer a lifeline and are often the first step toward safety and recovery. Education and awareness campaigns are essential in dismantling the stigma surrounding domestic abuse and encouraging victims to speak up. Legal systems must also evolve to provide more robust protection and",

For this reason, many students of medical education facilities seek to acquire as much theoretical and practical expertise as possible before graduation. Although such a strategy is by no means wrong, I have recently discovered that the true success in the work of healthcare providers is explained by the doctor's ability to build relationships with one's patients. I fully understood the advantage of this simple but often overlooked truth when observing Dr. Wang's work. Dr. Wang is an experienced professional working in the sphere of eye care.\n\nIn his practice, Dr. Wang demonstrates that the art of medicine extends beyond technical proficiency. His approach to patient care is characterized by empathy, patience, and effective communication. During consultations, he takes the time to listen to his patients' concerns, ensuring they feel heard and understood. This fosters trust and alleviates anxiety, ultimately leading to better patient compliance and outcomes. Dr. Wang's interpersonal skills create a comforting environment",
        "Various cultures around the world have unique creation myths and traditional methods of presenting them through art. The cosmology of the Aztec civilization was quite different from the Europeans that conquered them. Firstly, the Europeans' Christian God \u201ccreated mankind in his own image\u201d and granted him dominion over a perfectly constructed world, the Garden of Eden (Holy Bible, New International Version, Genesis 1:27). In the Bible, he is described as a benevolent, if strict, father figure who can forgive humankind their sins and grant them eternal redemption. Consequently, God is depicted in art as a wise and omnipotent ruler, often shown as a serene, grandfatherly figure surrounded by angels and symbols of purity.\n\nIn contrast, the Aztec creation myth is a tale of struggle and sacrifice. The Aztecs believed in a pantheon of gods, each responsible for different aspects of the world. Their creation story, involving gods such as Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca,",
        "It isn't easy to single out the central directions and build a particular hierarchy in the modern art world, including music. Some of the performers influence the minds of young people, and political strategists can use some compositions during elections. The current state of the art is too vague to make clear statements on this subject. Hip-hop performers expose many of the problems of megacities and young people: drugs, cruelty, violence, and lack of life guidelines (Rabinowitch, 2020). The social movement for women's rights is significant for the modern generation, and female performers are becoming increasingly influential in shaping contemporary music and art scenes. Figures such as Beyonc\u00e9, Billie Eilish, and Lizzo have become cultural icons, using their platforms to address issues ranging from gender equality to mental health awareness. Their music not only entertains but also serves as a catalyst for social change, inspiring young audiences to engage with pressing societal issues.\n\nMoreover, the rise of digital platforms has democratized music production and distribution, allowing independent artists to reach global audiences without the backing of major labels. This shift has led to a more diverse and inclusive music scene, where voices from different backgrounds and experiences can be heard. The accessibility of music production tools and social media has empowered artists to create and share their work, challenging traditional industry norms.\n\nIn addition to music, visual arts and performance arts continue to evolve, often intersecting with technology to create immersive experiences.

        "There are numerous US criminal cases that raise the question of trying juvenile offenders in adult courts. Currently, almost in half of the states in the country, juveniles can be prosecuted and tried in adult courts. Pennsylvania is one such state, as there is no lower limit for the age someone can be charged as an adult with homicide. The 2009 case involving a double murder illustrates the numerous issues that take place in all similar cases. In February 2009, state police found 26-year-old Kenzie Houk, who was eight months pregnant, in her bed with a bullet through her head. Jordan Brown, then just 11 years old, was subsequently charged with the murder of Houk and her unborn child. This case quickly garnered national attention due to the age of the accused and the severity of the crime. As the case progressed through the legal system, it highlighted the profound complexities of charging juveniles as adults, especially in severe instances like homicide.\n\nThe crux of the debate centers on the legal and moral implications of trying young offenders in adult courts. Proponents argue that the gravity of certain crimes necessitates adult-level accountability, regardless of age. They believe that the nature of the crime, rather than the age of the offender, should dictate the legal proceedings. On the other hand, opponents emphasize the developmental differences between juveniles and adults, suggesting that young offenders lack the maturity to fully comprehend the consequences of their actions.\n\nThe Pennsylvania case of Jordan Brown serves as a pivotal example in the ongoing discourse about juvenile justice. It underscores the urgent need for a legal framework that balances accountability with the potential",

His death was reduced to a symbol, but it was much more than that (Sinzelle, 22). It was an act of defiance against a corrupt government that had killed its citizens. It sparked a revolution, overthrew the regime, and may even have caused the Americans to enter the Vietnam conflict with increased vigor and determination.\n\nThich Quang Duc's self-immolation was a poignant protest against the oppressive regime of President Ngo Dinh Diem, whose policies were discriminatory against the Buddhist majority.

        "In the grand scheme of things, prosecutors and victims of violent crimes are natural allies. The prosecutors strive to bring the offenders to justice, whether to fulfill their duty before the law or achieve career progress. At the same time, the victims get moral satisfaction when the criminals are brought to justice. Therefore, one might think that prosecutors and victims are naturally supposed to cooperate. However, this logical scenario does not necessarily happen in practice. Sometimes, the victims cannot adequately cooperate with the prosecutors due to the experienced shock, fear, or mistreatment in the prosecutor's office. During the investigation and trial process, victims may relive their trauma, face intimidation, or encounter a lack of sensitivity from the legal system.\n\nThe complex nature of the legal proceedings often exacerbates these challenges.

Not everyone is aware of all the circumstances and factors that affected the company's struggle, and only some people know how many resources, including places and people, were involved in the corporation. The record-breaking bankruptcy of \u201cthe seventh largest company in the United States and the sixth largest energy company in the world\u201d was surprising for the society (The Nigerian Professional Accountant, n.d., para. 2). This company was founded in 1985, and its first year in the market was marked by aggressive expansion and innovation in the energy sector. Enron quickly rose to prominence, becoming a symbol of corporate success and ingenuity.

It contributes to prejudice in society, causing a psychological impact on individuals and creating biased attitudes toward certain populations (Ayalon & Tesch-R\u00f6mer, 2018). Media is often responsible for stereotyping different age groups, in particular, older adults. This paper aims to discuss two examples of ageism and one example of a positive characterization of the elderly in the media. Cliches and stereotypes about older adults in advertising cause negative attitudes in people as they present unrealistic and out-of-touch messages to society. One common stereotype is portraying older adults as technologically inept, which perpetuates the notion that they are unable to adapt to modern advancements. This image is often depicted in commercials where older characters struggle humorously with gadgets or social media, reinforcing a damaging stereotype that undermines their capabilities.\n\nAnother example is the frequent portrayal of older individuals as frail or dependent, relegating them to roles of vulnerability. This stereotype is evident in various films and television shows where elderly characters are often shown in need of constant care or assistance, overshadowing their potential for independence and active participation in society.\n\nDespite these negative stereotypes, there are instances in the media where older adults are characterized positively. The film \"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\" showcases elderly characters who embark on a journey of self-discovery and renewal, highlighting their vibrancy, wisdom, and capacity for personal growth. Such portrayals challenge ageist stereotypes by demonstrating that aging does not equate to a diminished quality of life.\n\nIt is",
        "Gender Stereotypes and Discrimination Nowadays, gender stereotypes and sexual discrimination make people confront various issues which may lead to negative consequences. For instance, Sandberg (2010) discusses why men reach top positions in the workforce much more often than women. During her lecture, Sandberg addresses this problem by providing current statistics on the male and female employment gap, suggesting that it is highly more challenging for women to choose between personal life and career success. Overall, the Ted Talk is highly insightful, offering the viewers a chance to reflect on modern gender inequality difficulties. In this Ted Talk, Sandberg also highlights the deeply ingrained societal norms that perpetuate gender biases, particularly in professional settings. She emphasizes how societal expectations often pigeonhole women into specific roles, thus limiting their career opportunities and advancement. Sandberg argues that these stereotypes not only hinder women\u2019s professional growth but also affect their confidence and ambition, creating a self-fulfilling cycle of inequality.\n\nMoreover, Sandberg points out the lack of parental support structures and policies that disproportionately affect women's ability to balance work and family responsibilities. This imbalance, she argues, is not solely a women's issue but a broader societal problem that requires a collective effort to change. By advocating for shared responsibilities at home and more flexible workplace policies, Sandberg suggests that both men and women can thrive equally in their careers and personal lives.\n\nThe insights from her lecture encourage individuals and organizations to challenge traditional gender roles and work towards a more equitable environment. Addressing these stereotypes and implementing systemic changes can pave the way for a future where gender does not dictate one's potential for success",
        "The clothing industry is amongst the many monopolistically competitive industries. There are many clothing firms in the industry competing against each other while producing similar products. However, the firms in the industry earn competitive advantages by distinguishing their products through branding and advertisements (Davis and \u00d6zg\u00fcr, 4). Product differentiation is one of the strategies commonly used by monopolistic competitive firms. Product differentiation in a clothing firm can involve designs, the quality of materials used, and the prices charged for the clothes. In advertisements, differentiation is put in physical aspects such as color, designs, elastic, and different sizes (Davis and \u00d6zg\u00fcr, 8). This strategy of product differentiation elevates a brand beyond mere functionality, injecting identity, culture, and emotional connection into consumer choices. In this multifaceted marketplace, brands like Nike or Zara thrive not only because of their quality but also due to their unique brand stories and consumer engagement strategies. \n\nFor instance, the rise of sustainable fashion has prompted many clothing companies to adopt eco-friendly practices, which differentiate their products in an increasingly environmentally conscious market. Brands that champion sustainability, like Patagonia, leverage this differentiation, appealing to a segment of consumers who prioritize ethical fashion consumption. \n\nMoreover, technology plays a pivotal role in enabling differentiation. Through advanced data analytics, firms can tailor their offerings to meet specific consumer preferences, enhancing the shopping experience with personalized marketing. Online platforms have also allowed for innovative advertising strategies, reaching a global audience and fostering brand loyalty through interactive content. \n\nUltimately, the clothing industry's monopolistic competition drives innovation and diversity, benefitting consumers with a wide array of choices",
        "Subsidizing programs are considered welfare and net initiatives that the government takes to aid low-income families and individuals affected by poverty. These programs offset the essential needs of the citizens from health, food, housing, and education. Such an initiative aims to allow people access to quality services and save some money for their personal growth. The subject of whether the subsidizing of essentials causes an incentive or de-incentive to seek employment is a debatable one. An example of a subsidized program is the subsidized housing, House Vouchers, and Public Housing programs. This scheme was initiated specifically for providing affordable housing options to those struggling to meet basic living standards due to financial constraints.\n\nWhile some argue that these programs create a safety net that discourages individuals from seeking employment, others believe they provide the necessary stability for individuals to pursue better job opportunities without the immediate pressure of looming basic expenses. These programs can serve as a stepping stone for financial independence by reducing the immediate burden of essential costs, thus enabling individuals to",
        "The rock and music pop scene were introduced to and gained popularity on television through massive hit shows for teenagers. The three primary ones were Where the Action Is on CBS, Shindig on ABC, and Hullabaloo on NBC. As more households had access to televisions along with the growth of a widespread range of programming, including musical ones, television played a significant role in distributing music to the public. The bands that appeared on these hit TV shows went on to see significant success in the charts. The television shows helped to articulate the new sort of youth music culture and almost became a cultural phenomenon in themselves. They provided a platform for emerging artists and established stars alike, bridging the gap between the performers and their fans.\n\nThese shows were instrumental in shaping the tastes of a generation, introducing them to new sounds and styles while also reflecting the dynamic social changes of the 1960s. They were not just entertainment; they were a social commentary, echoing the desires, aspirations, and rebellious spirit of the",
        "An aboriginal person is an individual characterized as a descendant of indigenous inhabitants of Australia. Before the arrival of Europeans, the indigenous people of Australia occupied most of the land, which they protected and fertilized to support cultivation. The aboriginal people mainly practiced hunting and gathering as their source of livelihood before adopting agricultural practices. The aboriginal people arrived in Australia from Asia via Southeast Asia and have inhabited the land between 45,000 and 50,000 years ago. After the arrival of European colonialists, the indigenous people faced many challenges such as economic, political, and disruption of their tradition. The aboriginal people lost their ancestral lands, which were integral to their identity, culture, and spiritual life. European settlement led to the imposition of foreign legal systems and governance structures, marginalizing the aboriginal communities. This forced assimilation resulted in the erosion of traditional practices and languages, leading to a loss of cultural heritage.\n\nFurthermore, the introduction of new diseases by Europeans had devastating impacts, significantly reducing the",
        "The Alabama State constitution strives to provide and protect a wide array of citizens' rights. Most notably, some of these rights are replicated in the American Bill of Rights. Like the American Bill of Rights, the Alabama State constitution is equally detailed and has different sections that are dedicated to enhancing and protecting citizens' liberties. The standout element within the Alabama State constitution regarding the protection of rights is the freedom of speech. Within the Bill of Rights, The First Amendment guards the citizens' freedom of speech as it enables them to not only express themselves through speech but also via protest groups (Weinberger, 2017). Similarly, the Alabama State constitution echoes this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of free expression in maintaining a democratic society. Article I, Section 4 of the Alabama State constitution enshrines the right to free speech, ensuring that citizens can voice their opinions without fear of governmental retribution. This provision reinforces the belief that a well-informed and vocal populace is crucial to the functioning of a healthy democracy.\n\nMoreover, the Alabama State constitution extends its protective reach to the right to assemble peaceably, mirroring the principles outlined in the First Amendment. This right allows Alabamians to gather in pursuit of common goals or to advocate for change, fostering a vibrant civic environment. The inclusion of such rights demonstrates the state's commitment to safeguarding individual freedoms while promoting active participation in the democratic process.\n\nBy aligning closely with the American Bill of Rights, the Alabama State constitution not only reiterates foundational liberties but also highlights the interplay between state and federal protections. This alignment ensures that, regardless of governmental level, citizens'",
        "The American War of Independence is between the American colonies and Great Britain. The revolution's success eventually depended on the willingness of Americans to risk their lives and economic well-being in the name of patriotism. The revolution was a conservative attempt to preserve freedoms that seemed to be threatened by British politics. However, the war was accompanied by social and intellectual transformations that radically changed the nature of American politics and brought ordinary people into politics to an unprecedented degree. It was the main reason why the Patriots were willing to risk their lives for the sake of independence and change. Firstly, the Patriots wanted the American colonies to have the autonomy to govern themselves without the overbearing interference of British rule. The imposition of taxes and regulations, such as the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts, fueled resentment and fostered a spirit of defiance among the colonists.\n\nMoreover, the Enlightenment ideas of individual liberty and democratic governance inspired the Patriots. They envisioned a society where people had a say in their government, free from",

Two, the absence of warranties with the pirated software means they are exposed to increased security risks with the software containing viruses and associated malware that affect computers (Parson, n.d.). Third, the individual or society is exposed to legal risks associated with pirated software when caught using it. The ramifications of legal actions can be severe, resulting in fines or even imprisonment, thereby tarnishing reputations and causing undue stress.\n\nMoreover, software piracy undermines the software industry's growth, inhibiting innovation. Companies may face significant financial losses due to piracy, leading to reduced resources for research and development.

        "The difference between a doctor approaching a patient in comparison with nursing practice on the same subject can be an excellent topic due to the highlighted features that are emphasized when parallel. Thus, medical practice using one's physiological status while nursing also implementing psychological responses is an effective way in making the difference between the two clear while operating based on PICOT. The points to be included are the difference in the research approach. Since medical practice is more objective due to the fact that it relies on specific outcomes and facts, the research is quantitative. On the other hand, the PICOT question included in the nursing framework often embraces a qualitative approach, acknowledging the subjective experiences of patients.\n\nDoctors prioritize diagnosing and treating the physical aspects of a disease, focusing on measurable outcomes that can be empirically tested and validated. Their research methods typically involve controlled trials and statistical analyses to ascertain the efficacy of treatments. This quantitative nature underscores a systematic, often reductionist, perspective aimed at universal applicability.\n\nConversely, nursing practice emphasizes holistic care, incorporating both",
        "In general, numerous types of reasoning exist and find implementation, but not all of them bear special significance for decisions affecting patient care. Approaches to reasoning can be classified into types based on the inductive or deductive direction of inquiry, the use of analogy or abduction, the utilization of decomposition and evidence synthesis, and so on. In the healthcare field, reliance on credible evidence is what informs the professional community's approach to clinical reasoning, given that mere suggestions and excessive experimentation and creativity involve extra risks for healthcare consumers. Particularly, the so-called frequency-based reasoning dominates the field, as it hinges on the prevalence of conditions and the effectiveness of treatments across large populations. This reasoning relies heavily on statistical evidence gathered through clinical trials and observational studies, ensuring that the proposed interventions are grounded in empirical data.\n\nPhysicians and healthcare providers apply this reasoning by considering the most common presentations of diseases and the statistically proven outcomes of treatments. This evidence-based approach minimizes risks and maximizes benefits, ensuring that patient care is both",

Recession is danger, and danger is stress \u2013 in such a situation, the brain begins to rely on basic instincts of protection \u2013 to run, hide, survive. Crisis intervention is a relatively new discipline, the main task of which is to provide temporary emergency emotional assistance to victims of mental and physical violence (Colford & Cavaiola, 2017). Nowadays, there is a risk of economic decline which can seriously affect the entire population; hence, I would not like to underestimate the importance of proactive measures aimed at mitigating the potential psychological repercussions of economic downturns.\n\nThe unpredictable nature of economic crises underscores the necessity for societal preparedness, extending beyond financial strategies to include psychological resilience. As the economy wavers, individuals often face job insecurity, financial instability, and increased stress levels. These factors can lead to widespread mental health challenges, necessitating effective crisis intervention strategies. Community support programs",
        "One of the most critical factors of breast cancer development is heredity since it causes a genetically inherent disease. If the patient's closest relatives have been diagnosed with breast cancer, a tumor's likelihood is high even at a young age (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2016). Since one of the patient's close relatives had this disease, this diagnosis is indeed possible for her as well. Another significant factor in developing cancer is various diseases of the mammary glands, for example, \u201ccystic\u201d breasts. In the presence of such conditions, the formation of atypical cells can initiate a cascade of changes, potentially leading to malignancy.\n\nUnderstanding these risk factors is crucial for early detection and prevention strategies. Genetic counseling and testing can help identify individuals at high risk, enabling proactive surveillance and management. Besides heredity, lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise, and alcohol consumption also play a pivotal role in influencing breast cancer risk.

        "Students, parents, and teachers remain overloaded in today's educational system, which affects schools' efforts in building healthy relationships with the populations they serve. The categories above are heavily influenced by information overloads and the requirement to multi-task that permeates the modern educational system (Zarra, 2013). For students, it involves excessive pressure from the school system and even parents linked with remembering large amounts of subject-specific information, performing well on tests, and engaging in dissimilar activities to succeed (Zarra, 2013). The need to develop new IT and software use competencies aside from standard academic skills further stretches their capacity. Meanwhile, teachers face the daunting task of personalizing learning experiences while managing large classes and administrative responsibilities, which can lead to burnout. Parents, too, must juggle between supporting their children academically and managing their own professional commitments.\n\nThis overwhelming burden can erode the foundational relationships within the educational community, as stress and frustration often replace collaboration and understanding.

        "An initial reaction rate is an instant rate at the beginning of the response. The graph has the y and x-axis, y stands for the concentration of moles per liter, and x stands for time in seconds. In this case, the chemical reaction is going against time; at the beginning of the response, the chemical concentration is very high, hence considered a positive reaction. As time goes by, the slope decreases, giving a negative curve; therefore, the reactant concentration reduces within an interval of time. Instantaneous rate is an instant rate in time with differential rate, the change in concentration with respect to time at any given moment. It offers a snapshot of the reaction kinetics, crucial in understanding the dynamics of chemical processes.\n\nThis initial rate is significant in chemical kinetics because it provides insights into the reaction mechanism and potential rate-determining steps. By examining the initial slope of the concentration versus time graph, scientists can deduce the order of reaction and calculate the rate constant, k. Understanding initial",

        "Panama is a developing country with a fast-growing economy located in Central America. It has one of the highest GDPs in Latin America but is not devoid of domestic economic problems, such as income inequality and poverty. This paper aims to review two current news articles about Panama, which reveal the issue of the high unemployment rate in this country, which continues to increase and has taken the form of a crisis. The first article appeared in a Panama news outlet called Newsroom Panama. It reports that, in 2021, 108,975 people in Panama were searching for a job, and the unemployment rate had reached 14.5%, representing a significant increase from previous years. This surge in unemployment is attributed to the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted various sectors, particularly tourism and construction, traditionally significant contributors to the Panamanian economy. The article highlights government efforts to mitigate this crisis through various initiatives aimed at stimulating economic activity and job creation, such as infrastructure projects and incentives for foreign investment.\n\nThe second article, from La Prensa, focuses on the demographic aspects of unemployment. It discusses how the youth and women are disproportionately affected, with youth unemployment rates exceeding 20%. The article suggests that systemic issues, such as insufficient access to quality education and vocational training, exacerbate these disparities. Moreover, it points out that many young people are forced to seek informal employment, which offers little job security or benefits.\n\nBoth articles underscore the urgent need for targeted policies to address these challenges. By investing in education, vocational training, and inclusive economic policies, Panama can harness its economic",

Traditionally, nursing schools provided degrees of a Bachelor's level associated with the basic skills required by this profession. However, today, aspiring nurses have access to high-quality Master's programs that further develop their competencies. In this regard, a question may reasonably arise regarding the actual value of such degrees. In fact, Master's programs in nursing are essential for healthcare, as they align with the growing importance of nurses and the contemporary view of the system. Bachelor's degrees provide students with foundational knowledge and practical skills necessary for entry-level positions. Nevertheless, the healthcare landscape is evolving rapidly, demanding specialized skills and advanced knowledge.\n\nMaster's programs equip nurses with critical thinking, leadership, and advanced clinical skills, preparing them for roles in administration, education, and specialized practice. This advanced training is crucial as the demand for healthcare services grows, driven by an aging population and the complexity of chronic diseases. Furthermore, Master's-prepared nurses contribute",
        "The four goals of anti-bias education are forming identity, promoting diversity, teaching justice, and fostering activism. Identity formation presupposes that each child sees himself or herself as an individuum who associates himself with a certain family group. Diversity presupposes learning to respect differences between individuals and cultures. Teaching justice means teaching children to understand where wrong is done and to behave respectfully to all people (Derman-Sparks & Edwards, 2019). Activism is about educating children to be self-confident and not afraid to speak out for themselves. These goals are valuable since they allow children to grow into empathetic, socially responsible adults who are capable of navigating an increasingly interconnected world.\n\nBy nurturing a strong sense of identity, children gain confidence in who they are, fostering personal strength and self-awareness. Promoting diversity equips them with the skills to appreciate and embrace differences, leading to richer interactions and a more inclusive society.

These guidelines help protect the environment, improve the quality of life for societies, and provide a conducive working environment through recognizing and appreciating talented and hardworking employees. This increases customer loyalty as clients feel they are helping the business support worthy initiatives, thus, enabling more access to funds and allowing more investors to join and support the company. The business rewards employees through meaningful praises, which makes them appreciated. It provides workers a chance to lead by example and encourages a culture of accountability and growth within the organization.\n\nThe implementation of social responsibility policies is not just a moral obligation but also a strategic business tool.

In this regard, Fisher (2008) suggests ten principles that, in the author's opinion, should be central for any entity. Nina, the Administrator of an outpatient dialysis facility, emphasized three core business principles, namely decide who you serve, manage employees, and decide what makes you different, which helped her run the facility successfully. As for the former, deciding whom to serve is a crucial step as it determines the focus of a company's efforts and resources. By identifying the target demographic, an organization can tailor its services and products to meet the specific needs and expectations of its clientele. For Nina, understanding the unique needs of dialysis patients allowed her facility to provide personalized and effective care, ensuring a high level of patient satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nManaging employees effectively is another cornerstone principle that directly influences an organization's success. A motivated and well-coordinated team is essential for maintaining quality and efficiency in service delivery. Nina prioritized open communication, continuous training, and recognition of her staff\u2019s efforts, which fostered a positive work environment and encouraged employee retention and productivity.\n\nLastly, deciding what makes an organization different is a critical aspect of establishing a competitive edge in the marketplace. By identifying and highlighting unique strengths and capabilities, an organization can distinguish itself from competitors.

        "Medical institutions function to protect the interests of patients and meet their needs; they are now the object of attention of society as a whole. The population's confidence in the activities of medical organizations is an essential indicator of their effectiveness. Bringing current terminology and the nature of the relationship between patients and physicians into a state of certainty will help to understand and delineate the nature of consumerism in health care (Calnal, 2010). The absence or lack of trust is of particular concern to patients. They feel vulnerable not only because they are sick but also because of the research and treatment they have to undergo. Trust, therefore, becomes the cornerstone of the patient-physician relationship, influencing patient satisfaction and compliance with medical advice. The medical world has seen a significant shift towards patient-centered care, emphasizing empathy and communication to build and sustain trust.\n\nIn recent years, the rise of consumerism in healthcare has led to patients seeking more involvement in their treatment decisions. They demand transparency, quality service, and accountability, factors that significantly impact their trust in medical institutions. When patients perceive that their needs and preferences are respected, their confidence in healthcare providers increases, fostering a collaborative environment conducive to better health outcomes.\n\nMoreover, technological advancements and the vast availability of information online have empowered patients to be more informed about their health conditions. However, this also poses challenges, such as misinformation and the potential undermining of professional medical advice. Thus, healthcare professionals are tasked not only with providing expert care but also with guiding patients through the vast information landscape.\n\nUltimately, the integrity and credibility of medical institutions hinge on their ability",
        "Theodore Roosevelt was one of the youngest American presidents known for his progressive ideas and the desire to change society, addressing the existing distrust and helplessness. The decision to promote progressive ideas was not spontaneous, and he saw the movement as the possibility to protect the real rule of humans (Roosevelt, 1912). The characteristics of a progressive are the intention to stand for social justice, achieve good for all people, and improve the environment in which individuals should grow and develop. Being a progressive means being optimistic about every initiative and participating in problem-solving processes. There is no need to hide one's intentions or shy away from challenges. Roosevelt's leadership was marked by his unwavering commitment to addressing the inequities and injustices of his time. He believed that government should play a vital role in regulating the economy and protecting the public from the excesses of industrial capitalism. This belief led to significant reforms, including the establishment of antitrust laws to break up monopolies and ensure fair competition.\n\nRoosevelt's approach to progressivism was also evident in his efforts to conserve natural resources, as he established national parks and forests, ensuring the protection of America's natural beauty for future generations. His environmental policies were pioneering, reflecting his understanding of the interconnectedness between humans and their environment.\n\nMoreover, Roosevelt's progressive stance extended to his foreign policy, where he promoted a vision of America as a global peacemaker and a promoter of democracy. His \"Big Stick\" diplomacy emphasized negotiation backed by the threat of military strength, which he believed was necessary to maintain peace and stability.\n\nIn essence, Theodore Roosevelt's",
