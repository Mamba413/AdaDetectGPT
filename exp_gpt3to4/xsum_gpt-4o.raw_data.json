        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told.",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy at Melbourne's La Trobe University, told",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat.",

But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand. The panel found she had \"acted in an inappropriate way\" and ruled it was professional misconduct. During the hearing, the mother-of-three pleaded to save her \"very rewarding\" career. She told how the allegations had \"ruined her life\", calling it a \"miscarriage of justice\", but said she wanted to continue teaching. On Thursday, Mrs Hungerford was told she would be suspended from the teaching register for four months, but she will be allowed to return after taking a behaviour-management course. Panel chairman Gareth Roberts said it was the appropriate sanction to \"allow her to return to",

She said:\"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, we have absolutely every right. \"Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The four IRA men were shot dead after attacking Coalisland police station.

In the HMIC's Policing in Austerity: Meeting the Challenge report last year, Bedfordshire Police was judged to be \"requiring improvement\".

        "The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the centre-left think tank in Sheffield. The government said extra funds were being given to early years providers to help children from poorer backgrounds and close the attainment gap. The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London. Its survey also found five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million) - but the IPPR forecasts demand for skilled workers in the North is set to increase. The IPPR has proposed 11 benchmarks for Chancellor George Osborne's flagship policy to boost regional economies, including closing the \"stark\" gap in the development of children aged under five.

The authority said it was spending about \u00a3100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought \u00a350m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said. Others in Beverley have also welcomed the race's arrival. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson said he hoped having the start of the race would encourage other cyclists to visit the town. \"It's nice to see Beverley getting some recognition,\" he said. \"I think that a few people felt it missed out a little last year, because it wasn't shown on the telly.\" Garry Payne, who owns a cycling cafe, said it was \"fantastic news\" for fans that they would get a chance to get up close to the riders.

The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT.

Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings by establishing alternate crewing at stations with some specialist appliances. The proposals will be discussed on 2 December and there will be a full public consultation on how the Brigade will find the savings, LFB said. The FBU said it was \"opposed to the removal of any fire engine from London.\" A spokesman said: \"In wake of the Paris attacks, it would be dangerous and reckless to reduce the number of fire engines and we would urge the London Fire Brigade to think again. \"The ten fire stations that",

It now goes to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has warned that the passage of the bill will trigger street protests. It did not take part in the vote, but the bill passed by 310 votes to 0. The bill's passage through the Senate is less certain, reports the BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, as half its members are appointed. But this could happen as early as next week and would almost certainly provoke further protests. Advocates of the bill say it will draw a line under the political turmoil that resulted from the military coup in 2006 that removed Mr Thaksin from power, leaving Thailand bitterly divided. This turmoil included the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and then two months of street protests in Bangkok in 2010 that left about 90 people - mostly civilian protesters - dead.

Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than men",

Growth in temporary staff demand was also at its highest in nearly a decade.

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said whichever party formed a government after the general election on 8 June must safeguard access to workers the country needs from abroad, as well as invest in UK jobseekers. The jobs report found growth in permanent appointments continued for the third month running in April, with the fastest rate of expansion for 21 months. This contrasted with a slowdown recorded across the UK as a whole. There was also a sharp increase in temporary placements - the steepest since August 2014. However, the availability of workers fell further in April, with the sharpest drop in the availability of permanent staff in nine months. Meanwhile, availability of Scottish temporary candidates declined at the quickest pace in nearly two years. The IT and computing, nursing/medical/care and hotel and catering sectors saw the highest growth in demand for permanent staff, while nursing/medical/care, IT and computing and engineering and construction led the way for temporary staff. The report also found that average salaries for permanent starters in Scotland rose sharply in April, while the rate at which temporary pay increased in Scotland was the fastest recorded for a year.

It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes.

The fresh investigation by the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York and from the US Securities and Exchange Commission comes after UBS paid $780m (\u00c2\u00a3512m) in 2009 to settle a separate Justice Department tax-evasion probe. And it comes as authorities in a range of countries are considering examining HSBC's actions in helping more than 100,000 wealthy individuals avoid paying tax. UBS made the announcement as it revealed a better-than-expected 13% rise in fourth quarter net profit to 963m Swiss francs (\u00c2\u00a3683.9m). However, it warned the increased value of the Swiss franc relative to other currencies, following the Swiss National Bank's decision to abandon the cap on the currency's value against the euro, would \"put",

It was reported the pair were being treated as witnesses, rather than being suspected of any wrongdoing. The claims circle around a merger between the electronics giant's construction arm, Samsung C&T, and an affiliate firm, Cheil Industries.

The contest, which ends at 0600 on 7 July, saw North Korea move from 24th to 1st place in less than two days. Many of the votes are thought to originate from imageboard website 4chan, which has built a reputation for triggering online viral campaigns. The voting site is not endorsed by Mr Bieber's record label.

        "The launch of what was supposed to be its flagship model has turned into a fiasco for the world's largest smartphone maker. As the South Korean company scrambles to contain the crisis, we look back at the developments so far: 2 August: Samsung unveils its latest flagship model Galaxy Note 7 amid great fanfare in New York. The phone is packed with new features like an iris scanner. The initial response is good and expectations high. It's seen as Samsung's big rival to the upcoming iPhone 7. 19 August: Sales start in 10 markets, including South Korea and the United States.\n\nReports quickly surface of devices catching fire while charging. On 2 September, Samsung announces a global recall of 2.5 million units, promising replacements. However, replacement units also exhibit the same overheating issues. On 10 October, Samsung halts production entirely. The debacle results in significant financial losses and damages Samsung's reputation. The company is now focused on regaining consumer trust",
        "The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while maintaining operational efficiency despite financial constraints. The proposed removal of the engines is part of broader efforts to optimize resources without compromising public safety. According to the London Fire Brigade, these engines have remained unused for an extended period, indicating a possibility to reallocate funds for more pressing needs, such as staffing Fire Rescue Units adequately.\n\nHowever, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has voiced strong opposition. They argue that getting rid of the engines could jeopardize response capabilities in emergencies. The FBU emphasizes the importance of having reserve engines available for unforeseen circumstances, which can be critical in a densely populated city like London.\n\nThe LFB's assurance that no jobs would be lost and no stations would close aims to alleviate concerns among firefighters and the public. Yet, the debate continues on how best to balance fiscal responsibility with ensuring the safety and well-being of London residents.",
        "The news agency's account was suspended and it advised all tweets should be ignored until further notice. The false message said: \"Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.\" US markets were spooked by the tweet; the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 150 points as it was retweeted. On Tuesday evening, the FBI said it was investigating the incident. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters soon after the tweet was published that President Obama was fine, and financial markets quickly recovered the lost ground. AP said later: \"The @AP twitter account has been hacked.\"\n\nThis incident highlights the vulnerability of social media platforms and their potential impact on global markets and public perception. It underscores the importance of verifying information from trusted sources before reacting. Twitter has since taken measures to enhance security, reminding users and organizations of the crucial need for strong, multi-factor authentication. The hacking incident serves as a wake-up call for all news agencies to bolster their cybersecurity protocols.",
        "John McCormack drove for a further 30 miles in the articulated lorry after hitting the vehicle on the A9. Perth Sheriff Court was told there were three children in the car at the time of the incident. The 46-year-old was ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work and banned from driving for two years. Prosecutor Rebecca Kynaston said motorists heading north near the House of Bruar shopping complex saw McCormack driving straight towards them. She said: \"To their horror they saw the lorry coming south. He was on the wrong side of the road. \"They barely managed to swerve out of the way, avoiding what could have been a catastrophic accident.\" The court heard that McCormack continued driving erratically, oblivious to the chaos left in his wake. The family in the hit vehicle suffered minor injuries, but the emotional trauma lingered.\n\nSheriff Alison McKay emphasized the gravity of McCormack's actions, highlighting the potential for serious harm, especially with children involved. The court was told that McCormack had no recollection of the incident, citing a medical condition as a possible cause. Nonetheless, the sentence handed down reflects the severity of his recklessness.\n\nThe incident has sparked renewed calls for stricter monitoring of drivers with medical conditions that might impair their ability to operate heavy vehicles safely. As the victims recover, the focus shifts to ensuring that such dangerous occurrences are prevented in the future, emphasizing road safety and responsibility.",
        "In a statement, it said Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay would raise the issue at a major two-day Asia-Europe summit starting on Friday, attended by China's Premier Li Keqiang. A UN-backed tribunal ruled on Tuesday that there was no legal basis to China's claims in the South China Sea. China has vowed to ignore the ruling. It says the panel has no jurisdiction and its activities in the region will not be affected. The Asia-Europe Meeting Summit (Asem) in Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia on Friday and Saturday will be the first major gathering of world leaders following the tribunal's decision. The decision has intensified tensions in the region, as several countries have competing claims. Yasay's initiative to bring this issue to the summit indicates a concerted effort by the Philippines to garner international support for the tribunal's decision. Meanwhile, China remains steadfast in its position, emphasizing its historical claims and asserting its strategic interests in the region.

More than 60 world leaders, 4,000 delegates, and 1,500 journalists have spent two days at the Celtic Manor Resort for one of the biggest ever international gatherings in the UK. Mr. Crabb said: \"We wanted it to reflect the best of what Wales has to offer, from our rich cultural heritage to our capacity for hosting global events smoothly and efficiently.\"\n\nThe summit was not only a diplomatic success but also a significant boost for the Welsh economy, providing a platform for showcasing local talent and business.

President Jonathan was among those unable to cast his vote using the technology, which was introduced to prevent fraud. His Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who had opposed the card readers, called it a \"huge national embarrassment\". The Inec chair, Attahiru Jega, stressed that only a fraction of the polling stations encountered issues with the card readers, emphasizing that the majority of the process went smoothly.\n\nDespite these challenges, the elections were marked by a high voter turnout and a sense of determination among citizens to participate in the democratic process.

There were 31.58 million people in work, up 44,000 from the previous quarter. That took the employment rate to a record high of 74.2%. But the number of job vacancies dropped by 18,000 to 745,000, the ONS added, marking the first fall for almost a year. David Freeman, a senior statistician at the ONS, said: \"The employment figures show a continued strength in the labor market, despite a slight decrease in job vacancies. This suggests that while employers are being cautious about new openings, there is still strong demand for workers in various sectors.\"\n\nThe mixed data highlights the complexities in the current labor market. While more people are finding jobs, the decline in vacancies could point to emerging uncertainties that may affect future employment trends",

A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries. An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies. In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company.\n\nThis unusual digital protest highlights the growing frustration among citizens as fuel shortages disrupt daily life, causing long queues at remaining operational petrol stations. The strikes, organized by labor unions in response to proposed changes in labor regulations, have intensified, drawing attention to the broader implications for the nation's energy sector.

Mr Dutton said there was a \"growing threat\" from Australians attempting to join groups like Islamic State (IS). Special anti-terror teams were installed in Australia's eight international airports in August. The teenager, who was on his way to the conflict in the Middle East, was returned to the custody of his parents while investigations continued, said Mr Dutton. The interception came about a week after two Sydney brothers, aged 16 and 17, were stopped at the same airport. \n\nThese incidents underscore the rising concerns about domestic radicalization among Australian youth. The swift actions by the newly established anti-terror units highlight the seriousness with which Australian authorities are addressing the issue. Mr. Dutton emphasized the importance of vigilance and robust intelligence-sharing to prevent young Australians from being lured into overseas conflict zones.

        "The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Friday. It now goes to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has warned that the passage of the bill will trigger street protests. It did not take part in the vote, but the bill passed by 310 votes to 0. The bill's passage through the Senate is less certain, reports the BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, as half its members are appointed. But this could happen as early as next week and would almost certainly heighten tensions in Thailand, where political divisions have been deeply entrenched since the 2006 coup. The amnesty bill is seen by many as a move to pave the way for the return of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who has been living in self-imposed exile to evade a corruption conviction.\n\nSupporters of the bill argue that it is a necessary step towards national reconciliation, aiming to heal the wounds of past political conflicts. However, critics fear it might lead to impunity for political leaders and officials involved in significant abuses of power.\n\nThe Democrat Party, along with civil society groups, has vowed to organize mass demonstrations, claiming that the bill undermines justice and accountability. As the country braces for potential unrest, the Thai government faces the challenge of balancing political stability with the quest for reconciliation in a nation still divided over its political future.",

Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies, it has had a destabilizing effect, contributing to financial volatility.\n\nCarney emphasized that coordinated efforts are needed to channel investment toward sustainable infrastructure in emerging markets, which could simultaneously address environmental challenges and foster economic growth. By leveraging their G20 leadership, Germany and other advanced economies can facilitate frameworks that encourage stable, long-term investments. This, Carney argued, would not only counteract the adverse effects of climate change",

The St David's Day Agreement had said the vote would be an \"expectation\", and Labour Welsh ministers oppose a referendum before a funding deal. Labour accused the Tories of trying to hold them \"over a barrel\". The manifesto states the Conservatives would \"introduce a 'funding floor' to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament\". But a Welsh Conservative spokeswoman told BBC News that the referendum would ensure that the public has a say in how such financial mechanisms are implemented. \"This is about giving the people of Wales a voice in decisions that directly impact their economic future,\" she stated. The controversy stems from the differing priorities between the Welsh Labour ministers and the Conservative party. While Labour is focused on securing a funding agreement without the precondition of a referendum, the Conservatives argue that democratic involvement is crucial before any financial policy shifts.\n\nThe proposed 'funding floor' aims to stabilize and safeguard funding levels as a baseline financial guarantee for Wales. However, Labour's resistance reflects concerns that attaching it to a referendum could delay essential funding agreements. This political back-and-forth highlights the ongoing debate over fiscal autonomy and governance, as both parties prepare for upcoming electoral challenges, seeking to sway public opinion in their favor.",

This week we got another example of that in the capital when oBike launched. It is a company backed by considerable venture capital and it's putting hundreds of hire bikes on London's streets. The company aims to have thousands in the capital by the end of the summer, after already operating huge schemes in South East Asia. The big difference compared to the existing cycle hire scheme is the bikes have no docking stations. A locking rear brake means they can be left anywhere.\n\nThis innovative model promotes flexibility and accessibility, allowing users to pick up and drop off bikes at their convenience. By eliminating the need for docking stations, oBike hopes to increase cycling rates and reduce traffic congestion in urban areas.

The results came from a survey of 504 UK residents, who had attended at least one festival in the last year. According to ticketing website Eventbrite, which commissioned the survey, these \"superfans\" help to \"drive the music festivals market\", often recommending music and events to their friends. They account for 28% of the festival-goers, playing a pivotal role in shaping festival culture.\n\nThe survey highlights how these dedicated attendees fuel the industry's growth through their enthusiastic participation and significant spending. By purchasing physical music formats and engaging with festivals in immersive ways, they sustain artists and events economically.

        "A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave. The research by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) blamed \"ingrained\" attitudes among employers, and concerns among new fathers that they could not afford to take leave. Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed.\n\nThe findings highlight a persistent cultural challenge within workplaces, where traditional norms often discourage men from taking time off for family responsibilities. The financial strain perceived by many new fathers further complicates the issue, despite revised policies aiming to offer more flexibility. Without a shift in workplace culture and more robust financial support, the intended benefits of shared parental leave may remain unrealized.",

They must do so to the sound of a single drum beat. This year all music must stop 43 metres away from the church so there is no music within earshot of it. A planned residents' protest has also been restricted to a maximum of 50 people at two locations. The Orange Order has said it is appalled by the determination. \"The commission is now simply a mouthpiece for republican propaganda, allowing them to dictate the terms and conditions of our cultural celebrations,\" a spokesperson for the Orange Order remarked. This ongoing tension highlights the deep-seated divisions that persist in Northern Ireland, even decades after the Good Friday Agreement. The Parades Commission, responsible for setting conditions on marches, has imposed these measures to prevent clashes and maintain peace in the community. However, the Orange Order views these restrictions as an infringement on their cultural traditions and freedoms.\n\nLocal residents, particularly from the nationalist community, often see such parades as provocative, further complicating community relations. The commission aims to strike a balance between respecting cultural expression and ensuring public order. As the parade proceeds under these stringent conditions, all eyes will be on Belfast to see whether the event unfolds peacefully or reignites historical tensions. Both sides hope for progress, but the path forward remains fraught with challenges.",

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said whichever party formed a government after the general election on 8 June must safeguard access to workers the country needs from abroad, as well as invest in UK jobseekers. The jobs report found growth in permanent appointments continued for the third month running in April, marking a significant upturn in the Scottish labor market. This upward trend highlights the resilience of the job sector, yet it underscores a growing concern over the declining availability of suitable candidates. This shortage poses a critical challenge for employers who are increasingly desperate to fill roles with qualified personnel.\n\nThe Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) emphasized the importance of political intervention in ensuring that the labor market remains robust. They argue that any incoming government should prioritize policies that both attract international talent and enhance the skills of local job seekers. This dual approach is deemed essential to maintaining the momentum in job growth and addressing skill shortages.\n\nThe Markit Report underscores how crucial it is for policymakers to balance the needs of businesses with broader economic goals. By doing so, they can sustain the positive trends in employment and bolster Scotland\u2019s economic resilience in the face of global uncertainties.",

One director said it was due to escalating costs and being owed money. Newport dairy farmer John Sollis called it a \"disaster\" for people in the area who were owed money. Documents lodged on the Companies House website show one livestock trader is owed in excess of \u00a3107,000, while others are owed significant five figure sums. In his report, liquidator Gary Stones said any payments to unsecured creditors are unlikely, given the financial state of the company's affairs. The closure of the abattoir has left a significant impact on the local agricultural community, with many small businesses feeling the strain of unpaid debts. Farmers and traders in the region are now grappling with the financial shortfall, highlighting the precarious nature of relying on a single entity.

Her lawyer said he believed she suffered from mental illness. \"You want answers in circumstances like this... mental illness doesn't always provide those kinds of answers,\" Ms. Murray's lawyer Keith Halpern said.\n\nThe discovery has shaken the small Massachusetts community, with neighbors expressing shock and disbelief at the conditions and alleged crimes. Authorities revealed that alongside the bodies, several children were found living in deplorable conditions. Child welfare services have since intervened to ensure the safety of the surviving children. The case has reignited discussions on mental health awareness and the need for vigilant community reporting to prevent similar tragedies.",
        "The care at Stafford Hospital left some patients drinking water from vases, it is claimed, and receptionists assessing emergency cases. Julie Bailey, who set up the campaign group Cure the NHS after witnessing her mother's treatment, was made a CBE. Helene Donnelly, a nurse who became a whistleblower, was made an OBE. Figures suggested there were more deaths than would have been expected at Stafford Hospital between 2005 and 2008. Patients needing pain relief either got it late or not at all, leaving them crying out for help, and there were cases where food and drinks were left out of reach. The Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust scandal highlighted significant failings in patient care standards. The subsequent inquiry led by Robert Francis QC called for widespread reforms to ensure patient safety and dignity. The recognition of Bailey and Donnelly underscores the critical role of advocacy and whistleblowing in improving healthcare systems and holding institutions accountable for their actions.",
        "Yorkshire batsman Joe Root has been named as new Test captain after Alastair Cook resigned after more than four years in charge. \"We need to win but we want to perform in a manner that makes people want to come and watch us,\" Stokes said. Root's first Test match as England skipper is against South Africa at Lord's beginning on 7 July. The 26-year-old has stepped up from vice-captain, with Durham all-rounder Stokes, 25, filling the role as his deputy. \"Test cricket is the pinnacle and we need people to be excited to watch it,\" Root stated. He aims to bring a fresh, dynamic approach to the team, promoting an aggressive brand of cricket that will attract fans. The decision to appoint Root marks a new chapter for English cricket, with hopes that his leadership style will rejuvenate the squad. Root's calm demeanor and batting prowess will be crucial as England faces the challenging South African side this summer.",
        "Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargoes without guarantees that port fees will be paid. However, creditors, banks, and the South Korean government are all reluctant to put up the cash. The global economic downturn, fierce competition, and falling prices have hit profits across the cargo shipping industry, and Hanjin collapsed with debts of about $5.4bn (\u00a34.1bn) last month. There are an estimated 89 Hanjin ships out of its 141-vessel fleet in limbo, stranded at sea or anchored offshore, as they await clarity on their future.\n\nThis crisis has led to significant disruption in global supply chains, affecting major companies that rely on timely delivery of goods. Retailers are particularly concerned, with the holiday season approaching, and many fear delays could impact sales. The South Korean government is now exploring ways to mitigate the impact on the economy while",
        "Buckingham Palace announced on Friday evening that the Queen would not attend because she had gastroenteritis. Lord Lieutenant of West Glamorgan Byron Lewis took over the ceremonial role. The battalion's commanding officer said it would have been a first to have been presented leeks by the Queen. The cancellation by the Queen led to more sparse crowds watching the ceremony than had been anticipated. Speaking beforehand, commanding officer Rob Manuel said it had been \"a bit of a surprise\" when the announcement that the Queen would not be attending was made. However, he told BBC News: \"We switched to the new plan seamlessly, ensuring the ceremony proceeded with dignity.\" Despite the change, spirits remained high among the troops, who were eager to uphold their traditions. Local residents expressed disappointment yet understanding, acknowledging the importance of the Queen's health. The event, while not as grand as expected, maintained its ceremonial essence and paid tribute to the Welsh Guards' storied history.",

A probation report three months earlier warned he might snatch a child \"at any time\", Leicester Crown Court heard. Jetha, 32, was told he must serve at least 11 years. Updates on this story and more from Leicestershire. He previously admitted some offences relating to last year's attack but on Monday changed his plea to guilty to all 10 charges relating to the boy, known only as Child A, which included photographing his assault. He also admitted a further series of unrelated charges, highlighting the severity of his actions.\n\nThe court was informed of how Jetha meticulously planned the attack, causing significant distress not only to Child A but also to the community. The judge described Jetha as a \"dangerous individual,\" emphasizing the need for a lengthy sentence to protect the public.

        "The H3 project combines back office services at four police, fire and council authorities in Hampshire and Oxfordshire, to save up to \u00a35m a year. The Police Federation said payroll mistakes were among a \"catalogue of errors\" since H3 began in 2014. Hampshire's Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) said the investment would deliver improvements by May. A report to PCC Michael Lane said H3 had caused problems with recruitment and the management of staff sickness, as well as \"weighing down\" police officers with \"back office processes which restrict their effectiveness\". In February , an internal review highlighted these issues, prompting calls for urgent reforms. The project, which was initially hailed as an innovative cost-saving measure, has faced criticism for its execution and impact on frontline services. Police Federation officials have expressed concerns that the administrative burdens imposed by H3 are detracting from officers' ability to focus on their primary duties.\n\nDespite these challenges, Hampshire's PCC remains optimistic about the future benefits of the investment. Steps are being taken to address the identified shortcomings, including improvements in payroll accuracy and the streamlining of recruitment processes. The PCC emphasized the importance of collaboration among the partner authorities to ensure the project's success and the delivery of promised financial savings.\n\nAs May approaches, stakeholders are keenly awaiting the promised enhancements, hoping that the H3 project will eventually fulfill its potential to provide both cost efficiencies and effective support for essential services.",
        "The proposals are believed to include tougher English language requirements for students. Dominic Scott, head of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, said it would be a \"nail in the coffin\" for recruiting overseas students. The Home Office has argued there are no limits on numbers of genuine students. Universities have already been lobbying ministers to remove overseas students from migration targets - but the new English language proposals, if they were given the go-ahead, would mean an even higher threshold for entry. Universities argue that overseas students are increasingly important to the UK economy and that raising more barriers sends out a negative signal to potential applicants. They emphasize the diverse perspectives and cultural exchange that international students bring, which enrich the academic environment. Furthermore, the financial contributions from tuition fees and living expenditures support local economies across the UK. As debates continue, stakeholders stress the need to balance immigration controls with educational and economic benefits.",
        "The Financial Conduct Authority said these customers were profitable for card providers and so there were few incentives for the firms to intervene. It said customers should be encouraged to pay off more of their debt when they could. The FCA inquiry has analysed the five-year history of 34 million cardholders. The City watchdog also interviewed 40,000 people about their credit card use. Its interim findings include: The watchdog said while there was strong competition for some customers and products, other customers were not being targeted. Providers were quick to intervene when customers missed payments as they were \"extremely unprofitable\", but they showed less urgency in assisting those consistently making minimum payments.\n\nIn light of these findings, the FCA called for a more balanced approach, urging credit card providers to develop strategies that support and incentivize customers to manage their debt more effectively. The aim is to foster a healthier financial environment and prevent potential financial distress among consumers who may otherwise be vulnerable to spiraling debt.",

Violence in the country began last April, when President Pierre Nkurunziza announced he would seek a third term. At least 439 people have died and 240,000 have fled abroad, the UN says. African Union (AU) leaders are due to discuss the crisis in Burundi at a summit in Ethiopia. They want Mr Nkurunziza to accept peacekeeping troops to prevent Burundi sliding into ethnic conflict, but analysts say he is unlikely to agree.\n\nThe arrests of the journalists have sparked international concern over press freedom in Burundi, which has seen a clampdown on media outlets since the unrest began. Human rights organizations have expressed alarm over the deteriorating situation, warning of the potential for further escalation. The AU summit aims to find a diplomatic resolution to the crisis, although the Burundian government remains defiant.

        "Ben Butler met a psychologist in 2004 after assaulting a man in a nightclub. Dr Tim Green wrote Mr Butler found it \"difficult to control his violence when he felt humiliated\" and \"historically would become angry and punch people\". The 36-year-old denies murdering six-year-old Ellie at their home in Sutton, south west London, in October 2013. Dr Green interviewed Mr Butler over four hours after he pleaded guilty to assaulting a man in Kingston upon Thames 12 years ago, the Old Bailey heard. Prosecutor Ed Brown QC read sections of the report in which Dr Green noted Mr Butler exhibited a pattern of violence, particularly when feeling provoked or humiliated. According to Dr Green, Butler's history of aggression was tied to a lack of coping mechanisms for handling intense emotions, which often led to physical confrontations.\n\nThe court at the Old Bailey was presented with this psychological profile as part of the evidence in the ongoing trial. Despite the historical context and psychological assessment, Butler maintains his innocence regarding the tragic death of his daughter, Ellie. He asserts that he did not commit the act of murder, standing firm against the allegations.\n\nThe case has drawn significant public attention, focusing on Butler\u2019s past behavior and its potential relevance to the current charges. As the trial progresses, the jury must weigh the psychological insights against the facts presented, striving to unravel the truth behind the tragic incident that took place in their Sutton home.",

And the \"chief mouser\" will stay when Theresa May replaces Mr Cameron as UK prime minister. \"It's a civil servant's cat and does not belong to the Camerons - he will be staying,\" a government spokesman said. The tabby cat, from London's Battersea Cats and Dogs Home, was brought in to Downing Street in 2011 tasked with tackling a rat problem, after a large black rat was seen scuttling past the No 10 doorway during live TV broadcasts. Since then, Larry the Cat has become a political icon in his own right, charming the public with his nonchalant demeanor and occasionally aloof interactions with visiting dignitaries. Despite changes in political leadership, Larry remains a steadfast presence, often seen lounging on the steps or patrolling the premises.\n\nHis role as \"chief mouser\" is more than ceremonial; Larry is credited with maintaining a rodent-free environment at one of the most recognizable addresses in the world. As Theresa May assumes her role as Prime Minister, Larry will continue his duties, bringing a touch of continuity amidst the political transitions. His enduring presence serves as a reminder that some traditions, like the beloved tabby, remain constant even as the political landscape shifts.",

But prison authorities say an outsider will not be allowed into the prison to prepare his meals. The king was arrested last month after a security force raid on his palace in western Uganda's Kasese district. More than 80 people were killed in the clashes. The 64-year-old monarch denies any involvement in violence. He was arrested with more than 150 people, including royal guards. His lawyer, Caleb Alaka, told the BBC he will challenge the decision, arguing that the king's health conditions necessitate special dietary considerations which cannot be met by prison food services.\n\nThe arrest and subsequent detention of King Mumbere have heightened tensions in the Rwenzururu region, where many view him as a cultural and spiritual leader.

The pair were spotted by Joop Van Der Linde, a guest at Ndutu Safari Lodge in Tanzania's Ngorongoro Conservation Area. The scene is the Serengeti; the attentive mother, five-year-old Nosikitok. The lioness has a GPS collar fitted by Kope Lion, a conservation NGO, and three young cubs of her own\u2014born around the 27-28 June. Dr Luke Hunter, President and Chief Conservation Officer at Panthera, described the event as \"a unique case of cross-species nursing.\"\n\nDr. Hunter explained that while adoption is not unheard of among big cats, nursing an alien species is unprecedented. Nosikitok's nurturing behavior may stem from her maternal instincts being at peak levels or possibly due to the presence of her own cubs.

        "The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday. The one-year lending rate will also be reduced from 6% to 5.6%. On Thursday figures showed China's factory output contracting for the first time in six months. Economic growth slowed to a five-year low of 7.3% last quarter. Many economists had expected China to stimulate economic growth through fiscal spending rather than lowering rates. To offset the effect of lower rates on savers the bank said it would give banks the flexibility to offer higher deposit rates, up to 20% above the benchmark rate. This move is seen as part of China's broader strategy to balance growth with financial stability. Analysts believe the unexpected rate cut signals the government\u2019s concern about the economic slowdown, which has been exacerbated by weak international demand and domestic challenges.\n\nThe People's Bank of China's decision marks a shift in policy, aiming to encourage borrowing and investment by reducing the cost of loans. However, the reduction also reflects deeper issues within the economy, including overcapacity in manufacturing and a sluggish property market.\n\nInvestors and businesses are now closely watching for additional measures that Beijing might employ to sustain growth. The rate cut is a critical step, but many believe further structural reforms are necessary to ensure long-term stability and prosperity in the world's second-largest economy.",

The fresh investigation by the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York and from the US Securities and Exchange Commission comes after UBS paid $780m (\u00a3512m) in 2009 to settle a separate Justice Department tax-evasion probe. And it comes as authorities in a range of countries are considering examining HSBC's actions concerning alleged tax evasion and money laundering.\n\nThis investigation marks another chapter in the ongoing scrutiny of major financial institutions accused of facilitating tax evasion. The use of bearer bonds raises significant concerns, as they can easily be used to bypass traditional financial regulations.

The IPCC report revealed the attack could have been prevented had arrest forms been filled out immediately. Det Supt Rachel Walker said officers had attended misconduct meetings. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) concluded that PC Sofi Essex has a case to answer for misconduct for not creating an \"arrest package\" - paperwork completed before arrest attempts can begin - when asked. \"Although eventually completed, the delay in preparing the arrest package allowed Hutsby the opportunity to carry out his horrific crime,\" the report stated.

The contest, which ends at 0600 on 7 July, saw North Korea move from 24th to 1st place in less than two days. Many of the votes are thought to originate from imageboard website 4chan, which has built a reputation for triggering online viral campaigns. The voting site is not endorsed by Mr Bieber's record label. Given the fact that almost all citizens of North Korea have limited access to international music and media, the possibility of such a tour raises intriguing questions and logistical challenges. Justin Bieber's potential performance in North Korea would likely be unprecedented, considering the country's strict control over cultural exchanges and foreign influences. While the poll may initially appear humorous or implausible, it underscores the unpredictable nature of online campaigns and the influence of digital platforms on popular culture.\n\nIf the votes were taken seriously, organizers would face significant hurdles, including negotiating with North Korean authorities and ensuring the safety and security of the artist and his team. Moreover, such an event could provide an unexpected opportunity for cultural diplomacy, bridging vastly different societies through the universal language of music.

Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are taking part in a pilot scheme following the study. Coercive or controlling behaviour became a criminal offence last year. The research found that although most domestic abuse incidents were handled in a \"professional\" way, some officers still displayed \"negative and uninformed\" attitudes. In particular, police tended to neglect cases where suspects did not use violence but tried to control their victim in other ways such as by making threats. The report said: \"There is a pressing need to educate officers on the nuances of coercive control, moving beyond the traditional focus on physical violence.

        "The site is believed to contain thousands of copies of a video game called ET The Extra-Terrestrial. A company called Atari made the game in 1982 but it was a flop and is famously thought of as one of the worst video games ever made. It's thought Atari could have dumped millions of unsold copies in a landfill site in September 1983. Presented by Gordon Sinclair from retro gaming event Play Blackpool, this tale of gaming's 'burial ground' has fascinated enthusiasts for decades. However, ET is not the only infamous game in history. Cassette 50, developed for the Z50 Spectrum by Cascade Games Ltd, is remembered for its low-quality compilation of games. Similarly, Rise of the Robots for the Amiga, published by Time Warner Interactive, failed to meet the expectations set by its marketing. Superman for the Nintendo 64 also joins this list, often criticized for its poor gameplay and controls. These titles serve as reminders of the gaming industry's evolution and the lessons learned",

        "The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling, was visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with 74 pensioner flats. Opponents insist the unlisted building is historically significant and an influx of elderly residents would put pressure on services in the village. The plans to be considered by the National Park Authority (NPA) are open for consultation until early January. Originally named Glasshayes House, the mansion house on the edge of Lyndhurst was built in the early 19th Century as a private home for railway entrepreneur Charles Castleman. \n\nLocal historians and residents have expressed concerns over the potential loss of heritage, emphasizing the site's rich history intertwined with literary and cultural narratives. They argue that the development could alter the village's character, urging for alternatives that preserve the property.
